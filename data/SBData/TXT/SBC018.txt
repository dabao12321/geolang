485.715	486.305		(H) .. probably the --

494.635	496.890		(H) in about six .. to eight weeks,
496.890	498.330		we'd have her come in again,
498.330	499.625		(H) we would tranquilize her,
499.625	500.645		and take the X-rays,
500.645	502.175		and see if it's .. h=ealed.
502.175	503.250		.. Enough to take off.

513.020	513.620		it's probably,
513.620	516.355		it would probably be even ... a hundred more.
516.355	516.720		but,
516.720	517.480		so it's,
517.770	518.125		(H) it's,

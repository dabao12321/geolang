499.190	499.701		I think,
499.701	500.850		.. probably,
500.850	503.511		... it's mostly posterior cruciate,
503.511	505.136		not so much anterior cruciate,
505.136	505.950		which is good,
505.950	507.168		(H) um,
507.168	511.315		... the medial collateral ligament,
511.315	513.420		that .. l=igament here is just minimally hurt,
513.420	515.158		.. (H) .. uh,
515.158	519.657		I think so=me of that ... posterior cruciate was probably already r- there,
519.657	521.021		and the reason I'm saying that is,
521.021	524.746		because it really ... doesn't hurt that much when I pull on it.
524.746	525.500		(H) See the --
525.500	527.645		.. This is the one that [pulls on that] --

541.308	541.610		I mean,
541.610	542.316		pretty simple,

545.185	545.556		so,
545.556	549.078		(H)= that's why I'm thinking that .. posterior is probably,
549.078	550.673		.. a lot of that's been there,

554.071	554.674		.. and y%- --

557.300	558.679		(H) Both of em are a little,

578.970	579.647		.. something.

639.690	640.998		and you can just do isometrics,
640.998	643.111		you can just .. l=ock your knee real stiff,
643.111	644.161		and just tighten your muscle,
644.161	646.170		hold it tight as you can for three seconds,
646.170	647.818		and then let it rest for three seconds,
647.818	649.467		and then tight for three seconds,
649.467	650.042		and then rest.

659.167	661.803		and you got some time to do some ... isometrics,
661.803	662.546		you can do that,
662.546	664.690		and then when you have other time you can do the weights.

702.953	703.534		where you didn't --
703.534	705.790		Wasn't getting yourself in awkward positions,

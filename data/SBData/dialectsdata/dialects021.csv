AUD,NA,SNEEZE
WALT,NA,a strong spiritual walk with God
MANY,NA,MURMUR_AGREEMENT
AUD,NA,SNEEZE
WALT,NA,H Let's open to Mark chapter uh five H verse thirty-five READ That day when evening came he said to his disciples H Let us go over to the other side H Leaving the crowds behind H they took him along just as he was In the boat H There were also other boats with him H A furious squall came up and the waves broke over the boat H so that it was nearly swamped H Jesus was in the stern H Sleeping on a cushion READ VOX Hey Man VOX READ The disciples woke him and said to him H Q teacher Don't you care if we drown Q H He got up rebuked the wind and said to the waves Quiet Be still H Then the wind died down and it was completely calm H He said to his disciples H Why are you so afraid H Do you still have no faith
AUD,NA,COUGH READ H They were terrified H and asked each other Q Who is this Q H Even the wind and the waves obey him READ Let's go on H Well READ they went across the lake to the region H of Geras uh Gerasenes H when Jesus got out of the boat a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him READ I don't think he walked up and shook his hand we're gonna see that in a second
WALT,NA,H READ This man lived in the tombs and no one could bind him anymore H not even with a chain
AUD,NA,COUGH
WALT,NA,H For he had often been chained H hand and foot H But he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet H No one was strong enough to subdue him H Night and day among the tombs and in the hills H he would cry out and cut himself H with stones When he saw Jesus from a distance H He ran and fell on his knees in front of him H He shouted at the top of his voice H F What do you want with me Jesus F H Son of the Most High God H F Swear to God that you won't torture me F H for Jesus had said to him H Q Come out of this man H you evil spirit Q Then Jesus asked him H What is your name H Q My name is legion Q H he replied H Q for we are many Q H And he begged Jesus again and again H not to send them out into the area H A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside H The demons begged Jesus H Q send us among the pigs allow us to go into them Q He gave them permission and the evil spirits H came out and went into the pigs aa H The herd about two thousand in number H rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned Those tending the pigs ran off H and reported this in the town H and countryside H And the people went out to see what had happened H When they came to Jesus H They saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons H Sitting there H dressed in his right mind And they were afraid TSK Those who had seen it told the people what had happened H T what had happened to the demon-possessed man H and he told about the pigs as well H Then the people MRC began to plead with Jesus MRC H to leave their region READ P and I'm gonna stop right there P H You know as we look at this we see that H the disciples H were afraid H They were terrified Of what had happened in the boat You know what it's like to be terrified Have you ever been terrified
AUD,NA,COUGH
MANY,NA,MURMUR_AGREEMENT
WALT,NA,I mean X that's X a pretty scary thing Isn't it
MANY,NA,MURMUR_AGREEMENT
WALT,NA,Being terrified is a very very scary word H especially if you've experienced it H Maybe you were in a car wreck one time I was in a car wreck coming back from Indianapolis one time H we were going sixty miles an hour H and we're going down the freeway and all of a sudden this woman pulls out of the ramp H trailor truck hits his brakes H he s he's he's behind us H I thought he's coming through us H another person smashes us we're spinning around the highway H glass is flying everywhere H and I'm saying Lord take me quickly I was scared to death I was terrified H We ended up in the middle of the median h and H I had to crawl out through a window to get out of the car I was terrified H I know that feeling H That's what the disciples were feeling at that time H they were terrified H They didn't understand H What was going on H And then we see the demon-possessed man H He was um H really think about how possessed he really was He was strong enough H to break irons
AUD,NA,Yep
WALT,NA,on his wrists and to free himself from the shackles H that were on his feet H And he cried out in the evening H and cut himself H with stones H I mean he was a pretty wild guy wasn't he
AUD,NA,Yep
MANY,NA,MURMUR
WALT,NA,But Jesus took good care of him H He gave him back his sanity
AUD,NA,Amen
WALT,NA,He gave him back his mind
AUD,NA,Yep
WAL,NA, H And the people came out to see what had happened H cause they heard about the pigs
WALT,NA,H And they came out it says H they were afraid too They were afraid H Just like the disciples were afraid They were afraid and they asked Jesus to leave the region H You know it's amazing but TSK that fear because they didn't understand H And they wanted to control the situation H You know fear is o crippling
AUD,NA,XX
WALT,NA,I mean it just knocks on our door every single day H Every single day we get up H it knocks on our door
AUD,NA,Amen
WALT,NA,We all have different fears H it kind of H pulls us in X it X entraps us H It keeps us H from moving H We become immobile And that truly is H what was happening H to the people H Their response was Q no thi this is incredible H This is the son of God H Look at the great miracle that he's performed H He's given this man peace H He's given this man sanity H He's given this man life again H And we're grateful to you Jesus H We're happy Jesus H We're excited about what you're doing here H SHOUT please stay with us H forever H we'll feed you we'll take care of you H We'll become your friends We'll sit at your feet H We'll pray with you we'll learn from you SHOUT>Q BUZZ wrong Q Jesus you just need to leave our region Q Cause they were afraid
AUD,NA,Mhm
WALT,NA,Because they MRC didn't understand MRC And they were no longer in control But Jesus was in control H They realized that what Jesus had done no other man could possibly do That there was something different about Jesus
AUD,NA,That's right
WALT,NA,H But their fear kept them from finding out exactly who Jesus was H Does your fear keep you from knowing H exactly who Jesus is H Does your fear keep you from a radical H relationship with God SNIFF H Does it keep you H from a personal H relationship with God
AUD,NA,COUGH COUGH
WALT,NA,H More than just going to church on Sunday H going to a mid-week service H or H even going to Bible talks Or group discussions Or one-on-one study H Does your fear keep you from that radical H personal H relationship with God
AUD,NA,XX

AUD,NA,That's right
WALT,NA,H And if we go back and we examine the Gospels
AUD,NA,Amen
WALT,NA,we see H very clearly H that all the time that Jesus spent with them H they were afraid H Peter was afraid H Thomas was afraid H They were many many times afraid H But they they understood H the only way they would overcome their fear would be H through Jesus Christ
AUD,NA,MURMUR_AGREEMENT
WALT,NA,And his example H Because the Lord had many challenging times H in his life H Where fair Where fear could be the dominant factor
AUD,NA,THROAT
WALT,NA,That could take away H his relationship with God

WALT,NA,H But the deep deep truths in your heart H Cause each one of us have some things in our life H that we're very fearful about H Ask yourself H Why am I afraid
AUD,NA,COUGH
WALT,NA,See we need to ask ourselves that question every single day H We need to ask ourselves that question every single time H it comes up H Because in that way confronting our fears H It will give us H a measure of success It will give us a measure of power H It doesn't mean we've done it yet H but when we bring it up it will give us a measure of that power H It will give us a measure of success
AUD,NA,COUGH COUGH

AUD,NA,Yes
MANY,NA,MURMUR_AGREEMENT
WALT,NA,Isn't that true

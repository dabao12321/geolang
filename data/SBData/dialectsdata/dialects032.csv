TOMC,SD,Mhm
TOMB,NJ,So I went to this H m what I thought was my friend um th this navy captain down at ah naval headquarters H TSK I said this is terribly awkward I've just been promoted from third mate to second mate H and and could we possibly postpone these orders for a little bit H My friend stood up behind his desk in his full four stripes and said H F Lieutenant H You are in the US Navy now F>
TOMC,SD,@@@ SNIFF
TOMA,MA/NM,@Hx
TOMB,NJ,I said oh
TOMC,SD,XXX
TOMB,NJ,No one ever explained that to me before
TOMC,SD,@@@@
TOMB,NJ,and a week later I was on my way out to Korea H @Hx H yeah
TOMC,SD,Oo
TOMB,NJ, 
TOMA,MA/NM,Where you got promoted really rapidly Right H
TOMB,NJ,Well no I uh v Finally uh I you know after a couple months I got promoted Lieutenant and you know and that sort of thing but uh H it was all
TOMC,SD,Mhm
TOMB,NJ,I loved the Navy I really did like the Navy
TOMC,SD,Mm
TOMB,NJ,It was just an exciting thing to do
TOMA,MA/NM,So how many years there
TOMB,NJ,I stayed in the US Navy seventeen years and ten months And then I was forced out because I failed a promotion to commander
TOMA,MA/NM,So but all that service time you put in Thirty-five or forty years or something like that
TOMB,NJ,Well but I'm am p
TOMA,MA/NM,Right
TOMC,SD,Mhm
TOMB,NJ,I'm on the retired list for pay for twenty-three years service
TOMA,MA/NM,Twenty-three
TOMB,NJ,Yeah
TOMA,MA/NM,That's That's that's what I was trying to get at
TOMB,NJ,So after all this happened
TOMC,SD,Now is that because of World War Two and the uh
TOMB,NJ,No it's because of the f the way the Navy worked And of uh
TOMC,SD,Mm
TOMB,NJ,H so I went to this guy and uh and and I was a reasonably hotshot officer in the Pentagon at the time and H and I went to him and said hey how come this is happening and he said well H there's happens to five guys like you H Because the way the law was written And we fixed it as of nineteen fifty-four H Instead of saying you if you failed a promotion you re H retire as of twenty years from your pay entry base date Mine was forty-nine H Uh they said H what we've now said is you have to stay twenty years So I said fine So handshakes all around
TOMC,SD,Mhm
TOMB,NJ,H Then I went off and worked for a couple of companies and
TOMA,MA/NM,Mhm
TOMB,NJ,H uh my my success in life if I can say it is is is consists of two things Skill and luck
TOMC,SD,Mine's primarily luck
TOMB,NJ,Ten perc Ten percent and ninety percent's the right mix
TOMC,SD,XXXX Mhm
TOMA,MA/NM, @@@@
TOMC,SD,@@
TOMB,NJ,And uh so anyway
TOMC,SD,<X Yeah X>
TOMA,MA/NM,H

TOMA,MA/NM,@
TOMB,NJ,and uh one damn thing another uh
TOMA,MA/NM,TSK H
TOMB,NJ,and then one day Debby said we're moving to Santa Fe and I said well

TOMC,SD,Sounded like a nice idea
TOMA,MA/NM,hunh
TOMB,NJ,Oh yeah Hey man
TOMC,SD,Hmm
TOMB,NJ,it was a binary decision
TOMC,SD,Alright
TOMB,NJ,I had no choice
TOMC,SD,let me ask you a very important question
TOMB,NJ,you know
TOMC,SD,And this is one that's crucial

TOMA,MA/NM,Yeah
TOMC,SD,Well you didn't do that then H But somebody did before that 
TOMB,NJ,No it's it's a little thing that sticks up above the roof
TOMC,SD,Yeah hm
TOMA,MA/NM,Tom thinks that mine doesn't work as well as it should because it should be extended like yours He thinks it
TOMC,SD,Yeah
TOMA,MA/NM,that the
TOMB,NJ,No it should j We we haven't done a thing with it
TOMA,MA/NM,It needs to be higher
TOMC,SD,X You see X because you get a down

TOMC,SD,H I think 
TOMA,MA/NM,You're probably right
TOMC,SD,H I've been trying to tell him the reason that H on very still nights When it's cold and everything else H he'll get a downdraft
TOMA,MA/NM,Hx
TOMC,SD,In his fireplace And it's because the cold air H builds up On the top of his roof and comes down

TOMC,SD,This state New Mexico
TOMB,NJ,Down around Roswell or Carls

TOMB,NJ,Okay
TOMC,SD,And then I worked for a rancher over there for a while followed the rodeos for a while
TOMB,NJ,Mhm
TOMC,SD,H uh and at that point I went into the Navy in nineteen forty-two
TOMB,NJ,Mhm
TOMC,SD,H Um never got past X furgot X Idaho and they discharged me H because I got injured H and from there I went to White Sands H New Mexico
TOMB,NJ,Mhm

TOMC,SD,Yeah they got me in the Army after I
TOMB,NJ,Even though the Navy threw you out

TOMB,NJ,Mhm
TOMC,SD,H TSK Then at that point I w got out and I went back to the University of Michigan I thought it was very important that I
TOMB,NJ,YAWN

TOMB,NJ,Is that a nonpartisan vote in this state or is
TOMC,SD,No w w well it is now
TOMB,NJ,Yeah
TOMC,SD,H um it At that time it was a very partisan type of a vote
TOMB,NJ,I see
TOMC,SD,And I H it was real interesting because uh I had never been in politics before
TOMB,NJ,I see
TOMC,SD,I had never been involved in it
TOMB,NJ,Course this is sort of Democratic state
TOMC,SD,H It was the Democratic State

TOMC,SD,H Albuqurque and Santa Fe uh
TOMB,NJ,Mhm

TOMC,SD,And um but I have really probably in my whole life have enjoyed the last H two years more then anything in being um a judge and a final arbitrator in a variety of types of cases H where I am selected H and they don't have to take me if they want me Y or if they don't want me
TOMB,NJ,Sure I see
TOMC,SD,And and that part I really enjoy Because H I know when I H when I get a case H it's because they want me to hear it
TOMB,NJ,Okay
TOMC,SD,Y and
TOMB,NJ,both sides
TOMC,SD,H And that's THROAT you know it's a little ego part
TOMB,NJ,Yeah Sure

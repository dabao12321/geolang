MITCHELL,CA,Uh I was called by Matthew here to do the job for him So I went out and looked at the job
JUDGE,MO,Okay you run a you run a a carpet business I presume
MITCHELL,CA,Yes I'm a licensed contractor
JUDGE,MO,Okay
MITCHELL,CA,Um the job was out at UCSB I went and estimated the job for myself to see if I could take the job for what he wanted to pay for it and I let him know that I could not Do the job I wouldn't make any money So uh upon me telling him that he offered to pay my employees fill out he had em fill out double-u two forms all of em and X he X paid him to lessen the burden of payment on me so that I in turn would make more money off the job I agreed to that after about
JUDGE,MO,Ca is that a normal procedure XX
MITCHELL,CA,Not at all He wanted me to do the job so he offered to take some of the monitory burden off my back so that I could do it for the agreed amounts that we were gonna do it on
JUDGE,MO,So in other words your your helpers would really be his employees for the purpose of this job
MITCHELL,CA,That's correct He had em all fill out the plo proper forms
JUDGE,MO,So then your costs would be reduced there as far as
MITCHELL,CA,That's correct
JUDGE,MO,Alright
MITCHELL,CA,Uh I went to receive my check of which we had agreed that he would deduct the amount of the hourly wage that he was
JUDGE,MO,Was this agreement in writing or verbal Hx
MITCHELL,CA,Completely verbal I've been working with him for like six years Uh upon a reve uh uh receiving my check uh for about two and a half weeks of work approximately between fifty and seventy hours I was paid three-hundred and sixteen dollars and fifty-one cents So I approached him with it and he handed me this yellow piece of paper here and noted that what the employees made and uh at twenty-six percent less deduction on these two employees Which was the employer contribution So I noted to him that he was supposed to pay that he said uh n no you're gonna pay it So I said that's not as per our agreement he said yes it is he handed me my check rolled up his window and drove off And he's there to state he's he saw that and was witness to that I have a letter
JUDGE,MO,I don I don't think it's relevant that he rolled up his window and drove off X
MITCHELL,CA,Well I know But that that was the end of our thing I tried to contact him everything finally I uh contacted my attorney I'd like to present this letter to you here
JUDGE,MO,Okay If I may look at that And have you shown that to uh Mister Collins
MITCHELL,CA,Yes please Yes He has he has received a copy of that letter X THROAT
JUDGE,MO,Now Stu Roberts is an attorney Is that correct
MITCHELL,CA,Yes sir
JUDGE,MO,You're uh
MITCHELL,CA,I'm his nephew
JUDGE,MO,P You're his nephew P And you're Nick Ro Roberts nephew too then
MITCHELL,CA,That's correct
JUDGE,MO,Okay So uh your uncle then wrote uh Builders uh a letter that's what I'm reading now
MITCHELL,CA,Yes sir
JUDGE,MO,Uh I do emphasize that I'm reading it this is not evidence this is only y your story that you've told Mister Roberts
MITCHELL,CA,That's correct That's correct
JUDGE,MO,P Okay P TSK So really the dispute then boils down to this twenty-six percent
MITCHELL,CA,That's it sir
JUDGE,MO,Okay
MITCHELL,CA,That's the reason why I had him fill out that portion of or he wanted to write those checks Was so I would save that money so I would do that job
JUDGE,MO,Okay
MITCHELL,CA,At the end of the job
JUDGE,MO,Mister Collins I know you're biting at the bit there you wanna Hx say something so why don't you go ahead
MATTH,MO,W Okay thank you your honor Um uh pretty much Hx um what Mitchell has stated is untrue Mitchell uh did do some work for me out at the college we did the Anacapa Residential Hall And this is a eight-thousand-yard job that we did this summer H It required us to employ oh five or six crews uh Mitchell Roberts was one of them that we used on the job Uh Mitchell expressed a desire to do the work out there he expressed he did not know how to handle the payroll Most of the uh contractors here in town that are independents like Mitchell don't know how to do prevailing wage statements X THROAT
MATTHEW,CA,The college is a state-funded uh uh remodel and on state-funded remodels we're required to pay prevailing wages Uh prevailing wages that um that indicate different levels of agility of the different men working And so uh a lot of the crews uh like Mitchell who have people that work under him around town in regular situations come to the people like me and ask us to do payroll for them When we do the payroll for them we state to them up front that uh we will pay the payroll we will make the deductions and then the employer contribution which is approximately twenty-six percent over and above the hourly wage is also deducted from the um subcontractor's check
JUDGE,MO,Now this uh th twenty-six percent that'd be be social security and what else would it include
MATTHEW,CA,Um Hx
JUDGE,MO,Sorta like um
MITCHELL,CA,X That's anything X above that
MATTHEW ,CA,ell you have You have X XXX
MATTHEW,CA,you have that I have a breakdown here of what we paid Mitchell's men
JUDGE,MO,XXXXX
MATTHEW,CA,if you'd like to see that
JUDGE,MO,Okay I mean do yeah y you got a total of uh seven point six five percent employer contributions on the
MATTHEW,CA,Um that explains it pretty well there's quite a few deductions of course X
JUDGE,MO,Oh and and the oh the the f the annual unemployment insurance and uh
MATTHEW,CA,Right
JUDGE,MO,Okay
MATTHEW,CA,worker's compensation
JUDGE,MO,Right
MATTH,MO,W FUDA FICA et cetera Now that's um in any payroll deduction situation you have the employee contribution which is deducted from the employee's wages gross wages and then you have the employer's contribution which is over and above that X THROAT
MATTHEW,CA,Which the employer has to pay Now the agreement that we had made with all of the um subcontractors uh Mark Preston's sitting here which is testifying for Mitch Roberts also did work for me and he was treated the same way We paid him we took his deductions out as well as that and so we uh did that with everybody
JUDGE,MO,Okay wai I wanna make sure now That would be fine if that was the agreement Now you say that the w you under you explained that to Mister Roberts
MATTHEW,CA,Uh yes sir Before he went to work
JUDGE,MO,Okay Mister Roberts did you have any conversations
MITCHELL,CA,Absolutely not
JUDGE,MO,with Matthew Collins about that
MITCHELL,CA,The reason and I stress this And I don't like to waste the court's time But my total I agree X If X whatever he just said right there was true with withholding and everything
JUDGE,MO,Right I'm
MITCHELL,CA,That was fine
JUDGE,MO,It really boils down
MITCHELL,CA,But
JUDGE,MO,what what was the discussion the agreement regarding this
MITCHELL,CA,The discussion
JUDGE,MO,X
MITCHELL,CA,The agreement would be that he would pay everything So that I wouldn't
JUDGE,MO,Did he say everything
MITCHELL,CA,Y everything So that I wouldn't end up making after fifty hou fifty hours work which I knew I was gonna make when I had to X play X my em part of an employer contribution I have my own payroll service They do all that for me and they're very familiar with all types of pay This is why I didn't wanna take the job to begin with
JUDGE,MO,Uh I can u
MITCHELL,CA,He in turn
JUDGE,MO,I can appreciate that now
MITCHELL,CA,Okay
JUDGE,MO,Mister Collins says he denies that you said everything Right X He just X
MITCHELL,CA,I wouldn't've I wouldn't've done it
MATTHEW,CA,Well
JUDGE,MO,You have a different story on what the agreement was
MATTHEW,CA,Right Um uh Karen here uh does all the payroll and uh she's here to testify about a conversation that her and Mitchell had in our office about this very thing and I'd like to
JUDGE,MO,Before or after the agreement was entered into
MATTHEW,CA,After the agreement was entered into he had been on the job for about a week or so and it was time I believe for the first or second pay period for his men Uh he came into the office and had a conversation with Karen about A the payroll and B this twenty-six percent that we're talking about And she'd be happy to tell you
JUDGE,MO,Okay ma'am why don't you please explain the conversation you had with Mister Roberts
KAREN,OR,Okay Um he was we were going over the wages for Phil Nigel who was one of the gentlemen on there as to how much Phil was to get for the job On an hourly basis And he had mentioned to me that he was wanting him to get ex amount H and I said okay if it's ex amount to Phil then plus twenty-six percent means I take out this amount from your check And he goes oh Well then no I don't wanna have the you know take out that much H So we were going back and forth with the figures and so finally this is the uh wage that we came up with which was thirteen fifty to Phil X THROAT
KAREN,OR,And then have seventeen dollars an hour taken out of Mitch s check Mitch Roberts check And this is the H note that I'd written down on that And then you can see that thirteen fifty plus twenty-six percent which is three fifty-one H would actually equal to seventeen o one and I said
MATTHEW,CA,Why don't you show him the note
KAREN,OR,You know just the seventeen was fine
JUDGE,MO,<X Oh this X> So d did you have that conversation
MITCHELL,CA,I don't I had that perfect conversation with her And that's very true exactly what you said But she never told me anything about this twenty-six percent that was coming a come out of my check Why It's X go ahead
MARK,NA,I was offered Matthew offered me I'm Mark Preston I'm a licensed contractor also and Matthew H offered me the same situation And it was my understanding that he was to pay everything Supply the glue TSK H supply and take care of my guys and make the payroll and pay all of the employer's stuff If you're an employer you gotta pay the stuff You gotta pay all the extra things
JUDG,NA, But you don't have any y you can't testify X COUGH
JUDGE,MO,unless I'm wrong about the conversation those two had You weren't there Is that correct
MARK,NA,I know for a fact that Mitch was mak-
MATTHEW,CA,He was not there
MARK,NA,M and he just mentioned that he H Matthew just mentioned that he deducted the same out of my check MRC He did not MRC I worked strictly by the yard and I paid my people Prevailing wages
JUDGE,MO,Well any agreement he had with you is not relevant to the agreement he had with Mister Roberts
MARK,NA,Well I saw the people's checks and I'm just drawing a pi verify what Mitch said H Ma Mister Collins was supposed to pay everything
MITCHELL,CA,He approached him with the same
MARK,NA,Fir f f with the exact same thing H And he d Jerry Stillman he did the same thing he did the same thing with Marco Villaremo Who're all licensed contractors
JUDGE,MO,But I still I still don't know
MARK,NA,THROAT
JUDGE,MO,that may have been on other cases the question is did he do it in this case
MITCHELL,CA,He it would be if X it may please you X uh the whole reason why I'm here Is because he took that twenty-six percent out that he told me he wasn't gonna take he used it as more or less bait me to do the job and went ahead and withheld it from me Without saying a word to it I had nothing I was expecting to make about a thousand dollars on the job
JUDGE,MO,I understand that
MITCHELL,CA,And when he wrote my check He wrote my check to me handed it to me through a window says that's the way it is and th and and you know it wasn't and he totally evaded me he has to this day evaded me
JUDGE,MO,Mister Roberts That's beside the point What I'm trying to We have to really hone in on what was the agreement Not how he paid you
MITCHELL,CA,The agreement was
JUDGE,MO,If he
MITCHELL,CA,That
JUDGE,MO,You know I don't care if he folded an airplane and ma and sailed it through the air
MITCHELL,CA,He would pay all my employees That was the agreement Everything
JUDGE,MO,But he di he disputes that
MITCHELL,CA,Well I understand that That's why we're here your honor
JUDGE,MO,WH Okay WH But you're the plaintiff You have the burden of proving your case That's the problem I have is you've gotta convince me by a preponderance of evidence that what you're saying is true
MITCHELL,CA,Well then if
JUDGE,MO,More more likely than not Now you say one thing and he says another
MITCHELL,CA,Then when when a person fills out or has other employees fill out the double-u two forms and everything why would I become liable for that contribution When h when he in fact by law is now employing those employees He's the employer I am doing nothing H Isn't there a law that states that fact When you have uh people work for you and fill out specific forms to the state stating that
JUDGE,MO,Tell me again Wh what were the what was the agreement again Go go through the y conversation as you saw it
MITCHELL,CA,Conversation was Mitch if you do this job I'll go ahead and pay all your employees and you in turn will be able to pa make more money
JUDGE,MO,That was pretty much it
MITCHELL,CA,That's it That's to the point
JUDGE,MO,Oh so he in effect said
MITCHELL,CA,And that's it
JUDGE,MO,I will pay your employees
MITCHELL,CA,That's correct And he did sir And then when it came to the employer contribution without my knowledge or anything until I received this check he just yanked that right out of my check
JUDGE,MO,And Mister Collins that conv tell me about the conversation you believe happened
MATTHEW,CA,Well um Mitch and I um Mitch had come to me and said he would do the work out there but he wanted to do the work under the basis that I paid his men and I told him about what I said earlier here
JUDGE,MO,About the twenty-six percent
MATTHEW,CA,Yes
JUDGE,MO,That was mentioned to him
KAREN,OR,Always
MATTH,OR,W Oh yes Uh always it was mentioned with Karen here on her note of nine two ninety-three that she wrote down her note that she talked with him RADIO X Twelve fourteen X
MATTHEW,CA,and at uh at every juncture He was uh made aware of the uh the contributions were made by the employer These were his men and we were doing a service for him under this agreement that we had between us
JUDGE,MO,Now just just seems from a logical standpoint I wasn't there obviously it seems like if you had said that to him he would've said wait a minute it's not worth it to me
MITCHELL,CA,That's correct
JUDGE,MO,Would you Would you think he would say that
MATTHEW,CA,Yes I would think he would Why would he do the work
JUDGE,MO,Okay
MITCHELL,CA,So you would trick me into doing it Tho
JUDGE,MO,Well not if he not if he said to you
MITCHELL,CA,No but  then
MATTHEW,CA, 
MITCHELL,CA,Then with all my with my fourteen years experience Why would I do that amount amount of work and knowingly for over fifty hours of work
JUDGE,MO,Well I XX
MITCHELL,CA,know I was gonna take him three hundred and sixteen dollars to do it
JUDGE,MO,That may be a like a buyer's remorse so I X uh I don't X
MITCHELL,CA,Well that's not I have fourteen years experience in the trade That's why I turned the d the job down to begin with X Without X doing any work at all
JUDGE,MO,Well I'll tell you if Mister Roberts testimony is correct he should win and Mister Collins testimony is correct then he should prevail
MITCHELL,CA,And I agree with you
JUDGE,MO,H Now
MITCHELL,CA,But the fact remains that I would not have done the work for this amount of money That's why I turned the job down to begin with That's why I'm here in the court today to make the court decide It shouldn't It shouldn't be legal for guys to do this
JUDGE,MO,Well I'm gonna make I'm gonna make uh in my mind a bad decision today Now you both seem very truthful and honest I wasn't there
MITCHELL,CA,But I'm the one that's bearing the burden of this monetary amount
JUDGE,MO,you have X to bear the burden X proving it but
MITCHELL,CA,I understand that
JUDGE,MO,I'm gonna award um Mister Roberts three-hundred fifty dollars Approximately half Now Mister Collins may not like that X now y X if he doesn't like it then he can go ahead appeal it across the street superior court Running the risk that he might face the full amount of seven-hundred and four dollars
MATTHEW,CA,I will appeal
JUDGE,MO,Okay But I'm going to get it and award mister Roberts three-hundred and fifty dollars and if neither party is happy maybe there's an old saying in court that both parties are unhappy the judge made a good decision So
MATTHEW,CA,Thank you your honor
JUDGE X,CA,Make it X for the uh plaintiff of three-fifty X There's some
JUDGE,MO,And I will allow the court costs of twenty dollars and thirty cents X I think there's some papers up there

REED,GA,Hey man
DARREN,LA,Hey
REED,GA,Good to see you well I see you went ahead with your plans to do a little skiing there
DARREN,LA,I did
SALLY,LA,
REED,GA,Well I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself too bad
DARREN,LA,Me too
REED a,LA,d she says you're getting better already ENV DOOR_CLOSING
REED,GA,so that's always a good sign
DARREN,LA,Yeah I mean I couldn't I couldn't begin to X deal with X the slightest pressure
REED,GA,Yeah X give it X easy easy yeah don't
DARREN,LA,H That still hurts back here
REED,GA,Yeah yeah Well you don't want to stretch see what happened you st Ch According to this other guy you stretched your ligaments in there H and the ligaments are the things that hold your joint together keep it from flopping around so H if they get you know stretched just a little when they try to peel down and tighten up and you don't want to H you know get em too lax while they're trying to tighten You know you want to let em heal as strong as they can I mean you can move it I'm not saying you got to go around with it just totally H but you don't wanna stretch those ligaments very much when while they're healing Just H Just gradually bring it around
DARREN,LA,Okay
REED,GA,Are you using any kind of walking aids
DARREN,LA,Hm-mm
REED,GA,Nope Just walking around Hunh
DARREN,LA,Yeah I had for the first two days I had a crutch or two
REED,GA,Okay
DARREN,LA,I switched from two to one like a cane and then I
REED,GA,Yeah Okay
DARREN,LA,Uh it was really icy there so I it had a spike on it so I
REED,GA,Oh that was neat
DARREN,LA,Yeah Peg it in the ground
REED,GA,If you forget and walk inside with your spike I guess you're not too well appreciated
DARREN,LA,SNEEZE No 
REED,GA,<X Bet you X>
DARREN,LA,No
REED,GA,Let me set you up there THROAT
DARREN,LA,Is it okay if I record this I I already have
REED,GA,Sure
DARREN,LA,It's for a project
REED,GA,Sure THROAT Sure
DARREN,LA,Cool
REED,GA,Alright what are you doing over there I thought you were doing something Hx different I thought you were working with languages in
DARREN,LA,Oklahoma
REED,GA,Hunh
DARREN,LA,Or in California
REED,GA,I mean well yeah y California your basic project
DARREN,LA,I was in linguistics That's what this project's for
REED,GA,Yeah that's
DARREN,LA,but I did a year of it and decided it wasn't quite what I really l
REED,GA,Quite quite what you want okay
DARREN,LA,Yeah it was an unfortunate cause I really don't know quite what I want
REED,GA,Well that's alright I mean there's a lot of things out there you'll find something
DARREN,LA,I hope so Hx
REED,GA,You know
DARREN,LA,I move to Oklahoma
REED,GA,X Completely My son is still flopping around he H He uh graduated from medical school this year and uh I mean he's in uh Soho in New York
DARREN,LA,Really
REED,GA,Starting an art career
DARREN,LA,
REED,GA,So so you see I mean a lot of people H you know I mean he's gonna paint for a year and just see whether he can do well enough with that to
DARREN,LA,Cause he doesn't want to be a doctor after all
REED,GA,Well he couldn't find anything he really wanted to do You know I mean he
DARREN,LA,Did he specialize <X at all X>
REED,GA,he H Well that's what I mean no he hasn't specialized yet But he couldn't find anything that just really pulled him toward it and so he said well H you know Hx H I guess he got a lot out of always doing art when he was young and he's gotta scratch that little itch I think
DARREN,LA,Good for him
REED,GA,and so he's up there and he'll give it a year and see what happens And the same for you you got H You got plenty of H There's uh fortunately this day and time I think it allows one to proceed like you're and you're proceeding and he's proceeding And I think it I think it's the right thing to do I would've d I would probably do the same thing were I you know another generation down the line H You know although I r I didn't make the wrong decision for me But I'm sure I would have been a lot more Uh uh I guess diligent in in working it out beforehand but H in in my time you know you really kinda just There wasn't too many things to do you know and you too many opportunities and so you just kinda H chose between a few and that was it
DARREN,LA,Yeah
REED,GA,
DARREN,LA,@@ H
REED,GA,@So a little simpler lifestyle in those days H Tell me where it hurts
DARREN,LA,Uh still a little bit back here
REED,GA,Mm-kay
DARREN,LA,Doesn't feel quite normal back there under
REED,GA,Okay
DARREN,LA,It originally hurt
REED,GA,On the sides yeah the sides don't hurt much
DARREN,LA,It would Not anymore I think it did at fir
REED,GA,Mm-kay
DARREN,LA,at first
REED,GA,great
DARREN,LA,He drew some blood out from here the first time
REED,GA,Yeah I saw that You got a little bit of blood not too much that's a good sign too Cause H usually when they're torn bad they have a lot more blood than that Is that doing anything
DARREN,LA,Nothing bad really
REED,GA,Which one hurts more back or forward
DARREN,LA,They're about the same
REED,GA,About the same
DARREN,LA,There's just this sense of constantly not being quite right
REED,GA,Mm-kay H Well see let me show you something over here Watch this one See I'm pushing back now
DARREN,LA,Yeah
REED,GA,and I'm pulling forward and it You get a little bit of pull coming forward it it moves out a little bit and but when you go back it kinda tight It's got a good catch to it you know
DARREN,LA,Mhm
REED,GA,over here H we're gonna pull pull it out
DARREN,LA,Wow it doesn't have that same movement
REED,GA,It's got a little more forward movement and it kinda has a kind of a rubbery kinda end stop there so uh H chances are Hx you've uh hurt that uh ligament in the back too H Uh
DARREN,LA,The crossband
REED,GA,Mhm yeah The Call We call em the cruciate ligaments He calls em the ex-bands or whatever they are
DARREN,LA,Yeah I don't know what
REED,GA,th they They cross and one H They cross because one's going forward and one's going backwards and they keep you from going forwards and backwards is basically what they do so
DARREN,LA,Hunh
REED,GA,H Pretty logical arrangement there
DARREN,LA,Mhm
REED,GA,THROAT Yeah it is Your posterior's messed up a little bit Hx
DARREN,LA,Well can that get better
REED,GA,Uh Hx mm P get a little better maybe P It's not gonna get all the way right
DARREN,LA,Mm
REED,GA,It'll be a little bit of a problem H I'm not sure you didn't maybe have some of that before I don't really know uh let me see w how much this hurts here
DARREN,LA,Mm
REED,GA,None
DARREN,LA,Mm-mm
REED,GA,Good H
DARR,GA,N My main physical activity for the past year and a half has been aikido ENV DOOR_CLOSING
DARREN,LA,which is a pretty gentle art
REED,GA,Mm Mm-kay
DARREN,LA,Lot of rolling lot of The knees do take something from that X I believe that they X A lot of work on em
REED,GA,Oh yeah Sure Any of those things gotta H put some kinda stress on your leg you know
DARREN,LA,I definitely want to get back to it though I had to lay off it for a while That hurts right over here
SALLY,LA,Okay
REED,GA,Mm-kay It's not too bad though
SALLY,LA,SNIFF
REED,GA,It's just very mild H uh that That one could probably See look at the difference on here now what see See how much of a jiggle you got there you got just a little laxity there right
DARREN,LA,Mhm
REED,GA,And this one's just a hair different I mean it But it hurts
DARREN,LA,A bit
REED,GA,Uh a little bit
DARREN,LA,It hurt a lot at first
REED,GA,But it's just a hair H and uh so if you just let that one kinda heal you know which I think it's gonna do cause you don't even complain much of this over here H You know when you're doing things you're thinking more about this back one and that's the posterior ex-band if you want to put it like that or posterior cruciate we call it
DARREN,LA,SNIFF
REED,GA,TSK Uh seems to be the problem H but it's not uh I'm not sure you didn't have a little bit of that problem before
DARREN,LA,It isn't All these years since the wreck the the leg's never felt you know like it it's never been totally normal but
REED,GA,Mhm Mhm
DARREN,LA,I just got used to it
REED,GA,Did your knee did your knee feel like it would
DARREN,LA,GASP Sorr that hurts a bit
REED,GA,X Where did that get you over here
DARREN,LA,Again yeah
REED,GA,Right Yeah okay That's okay H Did your knee feel like it had some play in it you know it wasn't real steady
DARREN,LA,I don't remember That being a
REED,GA,Being a complaint while you were doing your H martial arts stuff
SALLY,LA,SNIFF
REED,GA,Still <X hurt a little bit too X>
DARREN,LA,I injured the front of the knees when I was dancing for a while I was dancing with Kristy Hannah here few years ago and
REED,GA,Mhm
DARREN,LA,there were some times I came down on it and it did some
REED,GA,XXXXX
DARREN,LA,But that was impact injury
REED,GA,Yeah Right Let's see how rough that is Let your knee down Alright now straighten your knee out Yeah you've got a little Put your
DARREN,LA,Yeah
REED,GA,Put your hand You feel it
DARREN,LA,Yeah it's X
REED,GA,But that's pretty typical How about this one You got anything over here
DARREN,LA,X I've got a X X
REED,GA,no that's pretty slick Just a little click over there
DARREN,LA,Yeah
REED,GA,H Alright Hx Uh hold your leg real strong there let me pull on it And let's see if we got a pretty good muscle there Is that hurting anything
DARREN,LA,Mm-mm
REED,GA,Kay H Alright well I I think uhm TSK H You know I I think probably it's mostly posterior cruciate not so much anterior cruciate which is good H um the medial collateral ligament that ligament here is just minimally hurt H uh I think some of that posterior cruciate was probably already r there and the reason I'm saying that is because it really doesn't hurt that much when I pull on it H See the This is the one that pulls on that
DARREN,LA,It feels tight though a bit
REED,GA,Mhm When I push back I'm pushing on it That's And and that's not bothering you very much But see this one has been hurt and when I pull on this one
DARREN,LA,That does hurt
REED,GA,y it it hurts So I mean you know I mean pretty simple you know if if they've been hurt they gonna hurt when you stretch em you know so H that's why I'm thinking that posterior is probably a lot of that's been there H you may have hurt it a little bit more you know and y So you got this one a little bit and this one a little bit H Both of em are a little H both of em can probably heal up if you let em H and
DARREN,LA,No need for surgery to make it better
REED,GA,No Unh-unh And uh the the outcome will probably be pretty close to what you had before In other words H I
DARREN,LA,I may have lost a bit but it's not 
REED,GA,Yeah I mean you know five percent or something You know what I mean you know I don't know You know you'll just have to X Try to X have to see how it plays out But it it's gonna be minimal H And you can z You can overcome that a little bit by getting your muscle in better shape TSK There are two things that stabilize your knee H This is your knee brace the big muscle above your knee is the brace for your knee that's what holds it together when you're doing things H In fact you know all the sports players they Their ligaments have been stretched so much and repaired and stretched and repaired that they They're just not much good H and they really H have to compensate with their muscle power is what they do
DARREN,LA,They do a lot of leg lifts
REED,GA,H So right Uh you know just just uh you can do straight leg lifts or H what we call just those little short extensions just H put a bolster under behind your leg right here H extend the last twenty to thirty degrees with weight on your leg like this do little short extensions with weight
DARREN,LA,Mhm
REED,GA,H and keep working up on the weight
DARREN,LA,Mhm
REED,GA,you wanna b You What you wanna do and you can just do isometrics you can just lock your knee real stiff and just tighten your muscle hold it tight as you can for three seconds and then let it rest for three seconds and then tight for three seconds and then rest H And you don't have to move it when you do that H Uh Hx all kinda ways So just whatever the day will al permit I mean if you're sitting around and you got some time to do some isometrics you can do that and then when you have other time you can do the weights H But keeping this strong will compensate for your ligaments is the plan You know so uh H you know I think I think you'll find you you do pretty well
DARREN,LA,Do you think I can go back to aikido and stuff
REED,GA,Probably as long as it's not too too violent You know it's more form and shape and stuff or it's it's not too much contact
DARREN,LA,It's about
REED,GA,H
DARREN,LA,But no it's ideally it's about blending It's about blending with the attack it's not about meeting the force with force so
REED,GA,Okay
DARREN,LA,There's a lot of rolls
REED,GA,Okay mm well H I guess if you got good at at doing it you know where you didn't Wasn't getting yourself in awkward positions and you know getting your knee all twisted up underneath you or something you know you could probably handle it okay H I think I think you'll you'll be able to see for yourself Because once you get your muscles strong you get this thing controlling your knee well you'll see what kind of knee control you have it'll be pretty obvious to you whether you H you have the type of control to do that
DARREN,LA,What do you think the lesson should be from this I mean This is the first time I've ever been on skis I never did it before my wreck so I guess the less W one lesson is I'll probably shouldn't try skiing anymore
REED,GA,H Hx
DARREN,LA,I
REED,GA,He You know if it were me personally that would probably be the lesson I'd learn from it
DARREN,LA,Cause I'm lucky it wasn't worse When I
REED,GA,Right
DARREN,LA,It was a pretty bad fall
REED,GA,Right
DARREN,LA,the The incline was about I don't know what grade but H there was a turn in the wood It was this was in the woods
REED,GA,Yeah right
DARREN,LA,And it was cross country H
REED,GA,Yeah
DARREN,LA,So I didn't know what I was doing my girlfriend had taught me I had been skiing for two and a half hours I was tired
REED,GA,
DARREN,LA,and SM we were getting close to getting back SM H and I got carried away She showed me how when you're In cross country when you're about to fall you just sit down
REED,GA,Oh Okay
DARREN,LA,But I didn't do it right So H there was a turn and then H I And the skis don't snap off of course
REED,GA,Oh I know
DARREN,LA,And so it stuck and I kept twisting
REED,GA,You
DARREN,LA,and the knee took all the torque
REED,GA,%Oh
DARREN,LA,H And I didn't know what I'd done I screamed and she helped me and I manage to somehow I don't know S somehow managed to get up and H hobble on the ski pole all the way back to the cabin
REED,GA,Oh my God
DARREN,LA,and then we had to call the uh s the ambulance to take us sixty kilometers to H Oreille which is a ski resort
REED,GA,Geez
DARREN,LA,We were in the middle of nowhere H Hx H
REED,GA,Hunh
DARREN,LA,I'm a little I I think it's been three weeks now I I was hoping that you know you told me or doctor Smith told me that you know with chronic osteo it could come back from impact and I was And I really hope this is not the time you know I've made it how many
REED,GA,Ah that's unlikely
DARREN,LA,I've I have not spiked any fever or or seen any signs of
REED,GA,Yeah No it's it looks pretty good
DARREN,LA,I think I may have gotten lucky
REED,GA,Yeah if it's not hurting up there the pain would be H probably your first warning sign And you know
DARREN,LA,If that ever happened
REED,GA,Right You could start feeling some H change in the Hx the status quo you know Changes
DARREN,LA,I still feel
REED,GA,Yeah
DARREN,LA,It feels b pretty much like the other leg I mean
REED,GA,Good That's great Wonderful
DARREN,LA,Solid
REED,GA,Great
DARREN,LA,Well
REED,GA,Love it Well I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself it's a cheap lesson Right
DARREN,LA,That's right
REED,GA,@@@
SALLY,LA,
DARREN,LA,  I'd say so
REED,GA,H Yeah I I was out We were out and the kids were skiing you know and I was watching em go down and I WH was thinking God that would sure WH be fun You know And then s just barely my common sense won out and I decided not to do it but you know I've had two discs taken out of my back my neck fused for a bad disc H I don't need to go flumpity-bump down the hill You know I don't need any of that so H you just have to Hx have to kind of draw a few lines
DARREN,LA,Mm
REED,GA,but I came close to
DARREN,LA,It's tempting
REED,GA,to trying it it's tempting It's very tempting
DARREN,LA,It was fun I can tell you till I fell
REED,GA,Oh God It's It's just great You know but H then I'd have to pay for it for the rest of my life but I didn't know whether I wanted to do that
DARREN,LA,Not a fair trade
REED,GA,COUGH Not a fair trade
SALLY,LA,<X No X>
DARREN,LA,I wouldn't do it
REED,GA, Ch-
DARREN,LA,that's bad odds
REED,GA,Good to see you Come see me You know whenever you're in town
DARREN,LA,I will
REED,GA,And uh H let me know what you get into I'm sure it'll be something fun
DARREN,LA,I hope so
REED,GA,I think it will See you
DARREN,LA,Bye-bye
REED,GA,Okay
SALLY,LA,Okay Just let us know if you need anything
DARREN,LA,Okay

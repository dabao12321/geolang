SHARON,NM,Hx Hey Coop What I was gonna tell you about that really frustrates me is that uh H that the people principal and stuff they say to me TSK H Q Oh well what you do with those third-graders you know is you just like H take them and put them you know with one of the smarter fourth-graders who's very verbal
CAROLYN,NM,uh
SHARON,NM,and and well-behaved H And you have them work as a team you know so that the H fourth-grader can help the third-grader Q TSK H But that's bullshit Because that just teaches the third-grader with the lesser intelligence that H that he's worthless you know that he can't learn stuff on his own
KATHY,MA/NM,No it's not No it's not You can put them in teams like that but you don't put one with one You put like two fourth-graders with H how many third-graders do What's the ratio of third-graders to fourth-graders

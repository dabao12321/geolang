SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,What are you doing there
LARRY,MN,You're probably trying t VOX Yeah this is strange what's this guy doing VOX
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,
LARRY,MN,I'm putting water in a X twenty-six X gallon container inside my truck ENV DOG_BARKING_ENDS
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Wow That's quite a p
LARRY,MN,Cause I had to haul it to a property which doesn't have any water and I have to spray the road
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Ah
LARRY,MN,Cause the road before you can drive on it
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Interesting
LARRY,MN,it needs more uh more stability Evidently So give me one second to lock this thing and then XX
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Is that to keep the dust keep the dust down
LARR,VA/WA/NM/CA, well Hx no it's not that so much it's uh ENV DOG_BARKING_BEGINS
LARR,VA/WA/NM/CA, they put they put a uh a type of uh base on it that needs water and ENV DOG_BARKING_ENDS
LARRY,MN,that just hasn't happened yet
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Oh
LARRY,MN,X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I see So there's some chemical reaction that has to take place
LARR,VA/WA/NM/CA, Yeah I guess P a good a analogy P ENV DOG_BARKING_BEGINS
LARR,VA/WA/NM/CA, X Chelsea X no ENV DOG_BARKING_ENDS
LARRY,MN,That should hold it in there Okay Nice to meet you
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,How you doing Good to see you
LARRY,MN,What's your name ENV DOG_BARKING_BEGINS
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Seth
LARRY,MN,Seth Okay
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Here's my card here
LARR,VA/WA/NM/CA, Thanks Seth ENV DOG_BARKING_ENDS
LARRY,MN,X I think it's warming up a bit here X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Is this the house we're looking at
LARRY,MN,I'll take you down in the basement
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Is the furnace down in the basement
LARRY,MN,What's left of it yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,
LARRY,MN,We had all these
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Is it a old system
LARRY,MN,Yeah Hx We had the asbestos uh all removed from it and and uh
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Oh really
LARRY,MN,so that's been done
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I was j I was just at a place that does asbestos removal
LARRY,MN,Yeah where
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Cal Cal Tech
LARRY,MN,they're the guys that did it
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Are they Alright
LARRY,MN,Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,H 
LARRY,MN,that's down in Berkeley right
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,No they're they've got an office here in Nappa
LARRY,MN,Cal Tech X What was the X No Synergy That's who
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Synergy Dif different one
LARRY,MN,I I'm sorry It's a different outfit I didn't know they had one up here
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah Though I think they had just recently moved here
LARRY,MN,Unhunh
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,H Cause I was wondering t
LARRY,MN,So where's the man with the uh camera and the
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Oh I got the I got my recorder right here
LARRY,MN,@@@ That's pretty clever
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah my brother is uh teaches linguistics and I guess he's doing this study
LARRY,MN,Oh X okay X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,and they just want business conversations
LARRY,MN,alright Well
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Wow
LARRY,MN,Here's the animal hx
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,My gosh H
LARRY,MN,H
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Wow
LARRY,MN,They took uh some of it with em obviously
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Did this used to be used to be an old oil
LARRY,MN,Yeah I think it was an old
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,fire
LARRY,MN,I think it was an old see the oil THUMP tank THUMP here Isn't that an oil tank
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah
LARRY,MN,That's what my guess is And uh Hx X THUMP  THUMP>>
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Wow
LARRY,MN,do you have a flashlight on you
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Sure do
LARRY,MN,X Yeah X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So X then you X get duct work Or is this the flue
LARRY,MN,Well yeah What they did
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,That's the flue I guess
LARRY,MN,they they took the stubs and they cleaned em up Hx H So you can tie right into em See
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah So this used to have asbestos Hunh
LARRY,MN,Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Where did all this connect Was there a Ha plenum on top of here
LARRY,MN,So Yeah There was a big hood that went over the top of this thing with these H stack that went this way
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay Yeah like an octopus type
LARRY,MN,and then one that goes back un underneath there to the H to the uh kitchen there are there are different there are different ones that kinda go all the way up
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I see one r there's a rectangular one right there
LARRY,MN,Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,is that one right there w that I'm flashing my light on
LARRY,MN,Yeah it might be Hx It kinda looks like it And then there was there's one farther up H and then there is this THUMP one here THUMP
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So you X have X one two three H at least two there
LARRY,MN,Three and then there's another one way down H I don't know if you can see it or not but it's it's up into the kitchen
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So there's probably three back there H and a and any over on this side
LARRY,MN,Well H no but what what we we want to p you to kinda give us an idea on a w what your thoughts are
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,You wanna add a c add a few more
LARRY,MN,Add a couple Yeah Back ee way back there Is that one way back X Can't see it X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,XX get this thing
LARRY,MN,X To help X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,to a point
LARRY,MN,I don't know what this was looks like they
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,That was connected to one of em
LARRY,MN,Yeah They left that here
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I don't see any back in here but
LARRY,MN,H Well there's there's definitely one back there H Now there's nothing out here and this is where we feel we we should add one H Is this is a gonna be a dining room
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,okay
LARRY,MN,So H uh one for one there for sure
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,What about uh what about above this section of the house
LARRY,MN,Well let me show you that And you can give you can give me some idea about that as well
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Now uh you are on propane out here
LARRY,MN,No This is natural gas
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Oh really
LARRY,MN,Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Oh good
LARRY,MN,Kinda rare
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,That's good because uh the problem with propane is that they wouldn't be able to v H the co the county would probably have a problem with it
LARRY,MN,Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Cause they're very concerned about propane But natural gas I can put a H
LARRY,MN,Yeah we were real happy to get this place with natural gas
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Do you want me to remove the old furnace
LARRY,MN,We'll not have to
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,No uh do you want me to remove it
LARRY,MN,Oh yes
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay
LARRY,MN,Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,
LARRY,MN,No that's that would be part of our deal Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Well y the new furnace w would be much smaller That much I can guarantee you
LARRY,MN,Alright
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Do you
LARRY,MN,X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,How many square feet is the house
LARRY,MN,Uh well I guess it's around twenty-eight Approximately
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay
LARRY,MN,I have a roof guy coming about this time too so
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,You're doing the roof
LARRY,MN,doorbell rings we know who it is
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Getting a new roof put on too ENV RADIO_BECOMES_AUDIBLE
LARRY,MN,Well I got some problems with leakage in certain areas and just gotta get it fixed before we get the rain again Alright well let's start in the kitchen Okay this is Hx this is one right here See I don't think you saw this one but
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I'm wondering if you don't have a floor plan of the house do you by any chance
LARRY,MN,No We don't
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,X
LARRY,MN,H We didn't get anything when we bought this baby
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I'm wondering if I should just sketch it out
LARRY,MN,Uh
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,It's two-story though right
LARRY,MN,Two-story
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Th Are there X any X registers on the second floor
LARRY,MN,Unhunh
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay
LARRY,MN,So all those st all those stubs that were behind us are the ones that go up through the wall
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Oh Okay
LARRY,MN,H TSK
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Well that's no problem
LARRY,MN,Uh
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,as long as I don't have to do H any ducting to the second floor
LARRY,MN,yeah No X They X only the only thing that we wanted you to do is tie into the existing ones
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay
LARRY,MN,which are on the ground level
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,How about that one right there Is that one
LARRY,MN,Uh yeah That's one as well And then the return is back here
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay Good sized return
LARRY,MN,Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Now you're not looking at adding air conditioning Right
LARRY,MN,Well we would like to have that as an option
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,X Okay
LARRY,MN,We could always add that later Right
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah One of the things you can do if if you don't wanna do it now you can what they call prep for air conditioning You can put in the coil See you've got the furnace and the coil
LARRY,MN,X Yeah X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,H and then when you add air conditioning in the future all you gotta do is put the outdoor condensing unit and refrigerant piping to that coil So it saves it saves additional work in the future
LARRY,MN,Mhm
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Otherwise you gotta come back and put the coil in which means you gotta modify the duct work to get that coil in there so
LARRY,MN,Right
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,H if you're thinking about doing it in the future you might wanna at least put the coil in It only costs about three-hundred fifty dollars for the coil
LARRY,MN,Oh Alright
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,It's the it's the outdoor air conditioning X that X
LARRY,MN,Well write that in there anyway in the in the quote
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,TSK And now that's the the dining room you wanna add
LARRY,MN,Yeah If you if you go over and have a look at the dining room
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,You got a lotta glass in that room it looks like
LARRY,MN,yeah and we're gonna be making changes to the to the house too so we're keeping that in mind But if you notice there are no registers in here So
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,H Is this accessible
LARRY,MN,oh yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I wonder I wonder if was this added on you think
LARRY,MN,SNIFF
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,maybe I'm just wondering if that foundation wall
LARRY,MN,M- It might've been
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,goes to that I wonder if I can get into this
LARRY,MN,Oh you can get into it Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay
LARRY,MN,Oh yeah I've been under here
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Oh okay Good
LARRY,MN,So this is not a problem
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Shoot I'd probably go with two registers in this room
LARRY,MN,X Alright X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I'd probably go like one here
LARRY,MN,<X Oh yeah X>
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,and one one there
LARRY,MN,you'd do one over there as well
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Cause it's a good-sized room with a lot of glass
LARRY,MN,Okay
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Or you could do it you know you could put like one on this wall and one on that wall
LARRY,MN,Okay on the two two outside
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,And then I'd probably tie em both together
LARRY,MN,Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,into one Y-branch you know like the room
LARRY,MN,Mhm
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,the room is shaped somewhat like this X I could X put like one there one there
LARRY,MN,Now what we'd want you to do in this case is maybe
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,tie those together like that
LARRY,MN,See this this The end of this room might be modified So all we wanna know is is that we can eventually be able to do this Alright To to get get this duct work done when we do when we do the modification to the
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Oh so you may not do the duct work at this point
LARRY,MN,Not not in this room
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,X XX do it in the future
LARRY,MN,We m Yeah Uh I I hate to see us do it
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,X Where are gonna be your X
LARRY,MN,H although if we do it in the sidewalls
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Well what would  the modification be
LARRY,MN,Oh we might take this out and we might push this out further and uh well here's the drawings right here h P let's see that's the guest house Where is that sucker P
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Dining room
LARRY,MN,TSK H Yeah Yeah I It's right i here it i here it i here it is right here
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Is this the wall
LARRY,MN,you can see that H this is the current wall
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,oh okay so are you gonna go out like three feet or so
LARRY,MN,So we might we might we might do a little modification
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,a tape tapered uh corners
LARRY,MN,A tapered corner there H So we might do a little of that
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay
LARRY,MN,But if you're gonna put it in h this end wall then maybe it wouldn't be affected That one might down there Because we might uh
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah
LARRY,MN,XX
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,see well
LARRY,MN,H See eventually X we have s X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,you know you're right Cause I cause we're looking at right there course now you gonna go out
LARRY,MN,That's right See we're opening this
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,That's gonna go that way
LARRY,MN,that X it's X that that that's going out to this master which is gonna go up on the hill
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Aw so you'll need What about heating for that
LARRY,MN,Well what we're gonna do is put uh radiated heat
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay
LARRY,MN,In in there
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,That'll be a slab floor then
LARRY,MN,For sure Yeah yeah H Uh
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So that one might change
LARRY,MN,H Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,uh
LARRY,MN,I that's a that's a good point I've I I'm not uh we were th
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,The only thing is I don't know how long is that gonna be like in the future like a year down the road
LARRY,MN,Yeah Probably
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Cause it would be nice to have heat in here H in the meantime I mean say you do the furnace It would be nice to have it for this winter
LARRY,MN,Well let me work that out with my wife Put that as a
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,But one thing you can do even if you do a modification you can move the register I mean say we put the register right here and that's gonna b that would obviously have to be moved you know it's not a big deal to move it from here to here
LARRY,MN,Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,You might have to add a piece of duct work H but it's not gonna be a major change
LARRY,MN,Okay Okay
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,And this one you may not have to move at all That may be okay
LARRY,MN,Alright
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,But then that's probably how I'd do it some something like that or if I had the registers going that way that might be the best way to do it It'd be like for fourteen by six
LARRY,MN,SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I mean that would probably be an eight-inch duct that'd be an eight-inch that'd be a ten-inch and then the furnace I don't know it's somewhere over there Hx in that area
LARRY,MN,Furnace is
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I'm not sure how many feet
LARRY,MN,Well the furnace sits down over in this this corner over here That's where the furnace is
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,One Two
LARRY,MN,Probably right in here
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Three
LARRY,MN,And now That's probably what that's one of the
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,That's about thirty
LARRY,MN,key my key concerns
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,about thirty-six feet across
LARRY,MN,is th is the how noisy the furnace is That's a real concern to me And uh I don't know what they've got these days if they're all I know there's pulse type furnaces which evidently are kinda loud or something
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Oh yeah Yeah Lennox pulse
LARRY,MN,oh really
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,H That's a loud one
LARRY,MN,Is it
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,H Yeah
LARRY,MN,X Really X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I've put a few of those in and they
LARRY,MN,X Have you X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,H I've had problems I wouldn't go with the Lennox pulse
LARRY,MN,Okay
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,If I go with a uh
LARRY,MN,Well
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I'd probably go with the Carrier Carrier furnace H The return grill's plenty big enough
LARRY,MN,yeah It's a big return
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I mean I can't you can't have any kind of problem there
LARRY,MN,and a and and the pipes are big enough so and that's normally when you get you get a lot of noise in the house H Is if your if your uh ducts are too small Right
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Right H Yeah y the two main sources of noise are either uh air noise which is due to undersized grills
LARRY,MN,Really
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,you got air rushing through there at high velocity H The other source of noise is th is the fan motor itself H
LARRY,MN,In the in the actual
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,In the unit itself
LARRY,MN,Unhunh
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,And that's usually solved by b just having flexible duct between the unit and the d and the registers so that it dampens out the noise H In other words if we had the furnace like right behind that wall H it would be noisy
LARRY,MN,Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,But we're going d I'm not sure how it connects did we see that down there I'll have to go down and take a look at that again but
LARRY,MN,Okay
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,H I imagine it goes down H and then we can run some kind of a flexible duct to the unit As long as I can get say ten feet or so between that and the unit H then I
LARRY,MN,You can
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,then I can uh eliminate th the noise problem
LARRY,MN,Alright
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So it's basically thirty by thirty return air Thirty by thirty return air
LARRY,MN,And this is a uh this is the only return and I'd I would say not
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Oh this is return also
LARRY,MN,not placed not placed very well in the room
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,This is
LARRY,MN,So
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,this is supply though Right
LARRY,MN,this is the supply Right
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay H Yeah
LARRY,MN,See and I'd Hx Where would you suggest they would go If uh if we put uh
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Boy I would say g I'd probably go with two I'd put one on each side I'd probably put one like right underneath that window there and maybe underneath that window Be nice to put it behind the couch but then you've it would be blocked off too much
LARRY,MN,And you thi you so you you p you try and put em under windows where that's where your
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Hx Yeah I try to put em on the cold
LARRY,MN,X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,basically the coldest part of the room Hx
LARRY,MN,Okay
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,TSK Because uh it just helps y because otherwise you know with a grill right here H you end up having cold spots on the sides
LARRY,MN,Mhm
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Cause what happens is the air goes back to the return grill H so it never really
LARRY,MN,X It wouldn't get X out circulating through
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,it never really blows out to the corners
LARRY,MN,Right
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So that's why I try to put it as far away H on the perimeter and have it pull across the room
LARRY,MN,Okay well this is the only
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So I don't know if you'd wanna
LARRY,MN,the only the only other addition room where we thought maybe registers would be important And I'd I don't know if uh floor registers Are there are th i i i is d does it that's not a good idea these days
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,No I would go with floor registers in this house cause you got high ceilings
LARRY,MN,XX
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Well in fact you wouldn't be able to H put any kind of ceiling register in Cause you get the second floor
LARRY,MN,Right
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So no Floor registers are fine for heating
LARRY,MN,But th you're talking about wall regis putting em in the wall here
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,No I was I was thinking about putting em in the floor
LARRY,MN,Oh in the floor
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah to to go in the wall would be pretty tough
LARRY,MN,Okay Alright
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I don't know if you wanna cut the floor though
LARRY,MN,Yeah Well I hate to do it right there May maybe we'd do it right in here
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah But to get in the wall would be almost
LARRY,MN,X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I mean you can do that during new construction but it's tough when you're coming back after the fact cause X you just X got H
LARRY,MN,Sure
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,your your two-by-four framing and it's just too tough to get in there
LARRY,MN,Okay Alright So we'd put a couple in this room somewhere And then uh
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So this is like a family room Is that what this is
LARRY,MN,Uh it's kinda like a lo kinda a little parlor library something resembles
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Alright
LARRY,MN,XXX XXXX This is a register so that's okay Cause it's under there
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay
LARRY,MN,the bathroom has a register H now that was it XXX
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,How about the uh thermostat
LARRY,MN,This guy
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay I would definitely go with a new thermostat
LARRY,MN,Yeah Kind of a X antique
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,But that's probably a good that's probably a good spot
LARRY,MN,isn't it
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah that should be in a museum
LARRY,MN,Uh I don't know I i are we doing the right If I'm supposed to kinda walk you around the house here Is that what uh
SETH ,MN,eah Do you think ENV RADIO_BECOMES_INAUDIBLE
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,well I guess you haven't really
LARRY,MN,I don't know if there's anything you need to do up here Other than the fact X just X kinda know that we've got em
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah you haven't r really lived in the house during the winter Have you
LARRY,MN,No H And that's what we th
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So you don't really know if there's a
LARRY,MN,See and that's what we thought we would do uh Hx
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So you're not really sure if there's any problems with heating certain areas
LARRY,MN,That's right so X I sa X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So we don't know if there's any particular areas like that b I bet you that parlor room has had a hard time in the past
LARRY,MN,Do you think it's pretty cool in there
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Just that one grill
LARRY,MN,H And then this guy has a register so
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Oh they got AC up here too
LARRY,MN,yeah I n I think that's gonna go
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Well uh especially if you get the forced air H heating and cooling
LARRY,MN,Well Yes
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,you won't need that
LARRY,MN,One little guy there
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah see these aren't strategically placed either but you've pretty much got no choice H On most of these these it's almost impossible to to change these now but really on the second floor
LARRY,MN,This one's not too bad
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,H the heat the heat's gonna rise from the first floor anyway
LARRY,MN,Yeah up to You know
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So I
LARRY,MN,And it'll hold it in here real well
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah Typically and if anything you have verheating problems
LARRY,MN,Mm Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,On the second floor
LARRY,MN,H Well see that's what we wanted to do is have some kind of a system that we know we can shut off Certain certain areas Like if w
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,One of the things we could do I don't think they have any dampers here Do they H Oh they do
LARRY,MN,H Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So you can close off
LARRY,MN,Oh okay X So that's how it's X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah you can close off  individual d-
LARRY,MN,Close these off
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,H
LARRY,MN,and then the- then it'll force the air what Down into
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,H Downstairs Now
LARRY,MN,X
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,the one thing you don't wanna do though is close off too many of em
LARRY,MN,Cause then you put a strain on the
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Cause cause then you're uh yeah you've gotta have a certain amount of air H for the furnace to work properly And if you reduce the airflow too much H then it won't have enough air going across the heat exchanger and it'll it'll overheat the heat exchanger
LARRY,MN,Oh Really Okay
SETH ,MN,o I would say ENV RADIO_BECOMES_AUDIBLE
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,you don't want to close more than uh more than about twenty-five percent of em Or you can close em y you know if you close em uh a a hundred percent If you close em all the way you probably don't want to shut more than hx twenty-five percent of em All the way
LARRY,MN,Hx
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Which would b I'm not sure H maybe all upstairs H you might wanna leave em cracked open just a little bit though
LARRY,MN,Unhunh
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Just to make sure you get enough air
LARRY,MN,Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,H But okay so we'd be looking at adding two two registers for that parlor room
LARRY,MN,Adding two to that parlor room
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,And then what about that one Do you wanna hold off on that
LARRY,MN,Well maybe we should just
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Or would you wanna do at least one of em
LARRY,MN,TSK I think we should do something yeah Only because
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Because if that remodel's a year away then
LARRY,MN,I I th X I guess I th X I think this thing is gonna be a cold little
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,oh I can definitely see that
LARRY,MN,I I I can tell you that because the windows
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,See you only X like X the only heat you have in this room is that one register over there
LARRY,MN,the windows in this thing are THUMP just a+bout ready to fall out I mean they're THUMP they're not Look at this So I know there's gonna be a lot of uh
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,A lotta infiltration
LARRY,MN,Yeah Until we get this corrected
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,See hopefully you'll go with double-pane glass on your remodel
LARRY,MN,XXX
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,That'll help cut down a lot
LARRY,MN,Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,On your
LARRY,MN,Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,heat loss
LARRY,MN,So I mean in some ways having windows is it a bad idea Because you get a lot of natural heat from the the s from sun
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,That's right
LARRY,MN,X You knowX
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay this is like it would get
LARRY,MN,So
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,This is like east facing Right H
LARRY,MN,Yeah The s in in
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So you get some morning sun
LARRY,MN,You get the morning in the winter it's gonna come right across like this
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah
LARRY,MN,So XX
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So that's gonna be good
LARRY,MN,So that'll be good So maybe one register in here for the moment until we kinda feel it out would be uh
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,SNIFF Sure I mean this one it looks like if we put a register over here H you wouldn't have to change it anyway
LARRY,MN,Yeah No that that
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,With your remodel that might work into it
LARRY,MN,Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,And like I say even i even if you do have to move it H it's not X a big deal I mean somebody just moves it
LARRY,MN,Okay
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,you know a carpenter can do it even You don't even need to have us come out and do it really You might have to add a buy a piece of flexible duct and stick it on there but it's not a
LARRY,MN,Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,not a big deal
LARRY,MN,Okay Alright
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay
LARRY,MN,Well that sounds good
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Well let me check downstairs again I gotta take some measurements on that room
LARRY,MN,Okay Well now you get you've got the logistics of every Oh wait X And then I think X my wife
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Now you now you say about
LARRY,MN,my wife said she would like to have a register put in this room And I think it's kinda weird but Hx what do you think Why would she
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,What is this what is this room used for
LARRY,MN,TSK H Well eventually this is gonna be H uh Hx TSK and we're gonna open this up We're gonna take out some of these shelves and get some light to come through here
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,This is sort of like a pantry
LARRY,MN,But kinda pantry area But it's gonna be H an extension of the kitchen Kind of So H I don't know if
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,I'd Yeah I'd put I'd probably put one like right there About right there
LARRY,MN,SNIFF
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,You gonna be putting anything there
LARRY,MN,<X<WH I think WH>X>
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Probably something's gonna go there Right A table or something
LARRY,MN,H I don't know I Yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Cause that's about the only spot you can put it Well I mean y we could put a we could put a floor r floor register right along here I don't know if you'd want that But that's probably where I'd put it In fact the one that I was gonna put in there I'd probably
LARRY,MN,We might have trouble getting to this spot though I think
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,You think so
LARRY,MN,Yeah Cause it starts getting real tight up there on this end Yeah H Well let's uh
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Maybe on this end
LARRY,MN,Yeah It would have to be if anywhere it'd have to be down
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,X that's not a bad spot
LARRY,MN,okay
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,It's gonna help out cause I See this whole area H you've just got that one grill It's a pretty good-sized area right here
LARRY,MN,H Okay
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,What about the kitchen
LARRY,MN,Well let's let's consider that
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Kitchen's got one
LARRY,MN,kitchen's got one right here
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah okay
LARRY,MN,and uh I'm not too worried about the kitchen I don't like hot kitchens anyway Cause I mean y you got a stove going and VOX Ah we're in good shape that way Hx VOX ah Wait a minute X Did X I forget something else too Ah yeah We're gonna have to put a register out here Because y this this wall is eventually gonna come out And so uh
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Utility room
LARRY,MN,utility room but it's gonna eventually be part of the kitchen And we're moving the utility room So and this T This is a joke N_look at this
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,SNIFF
LARRY,MN,Hx
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,TSK_Well some of these
LARRY,MN,X Maybe maybe this doesn't make any sense to
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,well some of these things you may wanna wait until you do the remodel <X Like X>
LARRY,MN,I'm th- I'm I'm wa I'm beginning to wonder if
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Because what I would prob What you can do uh
LARRY,MN,HICCUP
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,is tap right off the plenum Cause the furnace is somewhere in that general area
LARRY,MN,It's right there yeah
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,And you can just tap right off the plenum with a duct and bring it to this room
LARRY,MN,Okay Well that's what we wanted to
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So that can be done
LARRY,MN,that's what we wanna kn wanna know
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,that can be done at a later time
LARRY,MN,Alright H But maybe t
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,That can be done at at any time
LARRY,MN,maybe for the sake of your quotation
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Really
LARRY,MN,you should say this is what it's gonna cost you to put in a duct here all these ducts at this time
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Yeah Okay
LARRY,MN,Now I don't know if H if we can price em out individually or not
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Sure I call this what utility r utility room
LARRY,MN,Yeah Just pu uh call it a
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,figure a duct somewhere on this wall you think
LARRY,MN,Yeah Let's just assume it'd be on this wall
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay Utility room kitchen that back one we'll call that pantry
LARRY,MN,Yeah Pantry and then you got the dining room glass
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,dining room
LARRY,MN,glass dining room
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,and then the parlor
LARRY,MN,and then the parlor one on each end there
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,SNIFF Yeah Cause we can do em now or we can do em later But it's not any more difficult to do em at a later time So it's not like you have to do it now
LARRY,MN,Okay
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,So the registers that we're connecting to that are existing how many of those we have got We've got the one in the kitchen and then we've got uh one in the d living room here
LARRY,MN,That guy then there's one in the bathroom there's one in the s study and there is one in the library Or in the parlor I don't know what we'd do with that Do we disconnect that if we put two or do you leave it
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Uh yeah I might disconnect that Well it's not it's not connected up right now So
LARRY,MN,Oh that's right
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,so it'd just be a matter w Actually it sh it should be capped off probably though And this is the study one right there and the bathroom's got one
LARRY,MN,Bathroom's got one over by the shower there On the floor
SETH,VA/WA/NM/CA,Okay Okay let me take a look downstairs again
LARRY,MN,okay

LENORE,CA,So you don't need to go borrow equipment from anybody to to do the feet Do the hooves
LYNNE,MT,H YWN Well we're gonna have to find somewhere to get Hx something Hx YWN
DORIS,MT,So Mae
LYNNE,MT,I'm gonna Hx
DORIS,MT,Mae Lynne XX
LYNNE,MT,H We're not gonna do the feet today I'm gonna wait till like early in the morning to do those cause y I mean you get so tired H n you just it takes well it takes me longer than most people cause you know I'm not as strong and H and I'm not as good as like somebody that would do it all the time You know I mean H X Oh X I mean I trim horses and stuff like that but I mean I'm not like H I'm not uh H I don't know how to say it But you know they do it for a living you know most people that you would get to trim your horse do it all the time H and I'm not Hx that good or and I'm not very strong
LENORE,CA,Did they train you
LYNNE,MT,yeah
LENORE,CA,Did they train you that XX
LYNNE,MT,yeah yeah
LENORE,CA,So you have your own equipment
LYNNE,MT,H
LENORE,CA,but
LYNNE,MT,TSK H No I don't have my own equipment at all Dad you know has done some of it That's another thing too is I kinda had a b general idea H of kinda how to do it just watching him or and watching H people come to our place and doing it and stuff you know H and TSK I don't know then down there um it's mandatory you have to to graduate you know or well to get the degree you know H you have to take this class H And you can only take if you want to you can only take it for eight weeks H And if you wanna go on in it you n then you can go on you know And I decided to go ahead and go on in it And the first part of it is like H well we have lecture then we have lab H And like the first part of it we just go into the classroom and he like H In the beginning of the year there was a lot of classroom work I mean it that's just kinda how it happens you know because he kinda has to tell you H they go over the whole the whole part of the horse I mean H all the skeleton part of it you know and and they go through every kinda ligament and I mean there's H millions of ligaments and millions of tendons you know well not millions but I mean
LENORE,CA,yeah I bet
LYNNE,MT,H and X then X so we had to know these tendons and ligaments H and then all the bones and you know all the way up from the shoulder down and then from the hip down You know all the way down to the hoof H and then the bone in the hoof and H then all the wall and you know of the hoof and what everything was called there and then H he went over on how to trim it and where you th there's a white line that you go by and a horse has this little white line H and you clean it out with the TSK with the hoof knife you know H and then there and then you can see this little white line H and that's kinda where you go by to SM you know the horse kinda helps you out because it has that little white line right there
LENORE,CA,mhm
LYNNE,MT,and that's where you kinda SM H kinda need a little guide of where you trim TSK H And I am still scared to do it because you know I mean HI you can make HI a horse go lame H By doing it
LENORE,CA,really
LYNNE,MT,Well you can trim em too short H And make em you know and they're just a little bit for f the first couple of days you know I mean they're just sore H That's not bad but sometimes you can get it really bad You can really make a horse really bad H And they m you know then they have to like H keep em Hx away from anything you know get em really in the soft ground and no hard pebbles or hard clods of dirt or anything H So Hx TSK H I don't know I'm a little scared about doing it yet you know I get em really long I mean they're still long When I get done with them H SM A lot of times like I'll get done and I'll think I'm done and I'll look at look down at the horse's hoof SM and it's still it's too long H And then like I would never ever ever trust myself to shoe a horse See we did that too we did H We did a lot of stuff we did a lot of stuff with the like we had the um TSK the burners you know and you'd put the H you'd have you started out with the straight iron you know H and you'd stick it into the into the H you know like SM actual blacksmithing H And you'd put it into the hot SM coals you know H And then we'd i i straight bar and we'd make it a a horseshoe out of it you know H But these shoes we never did put on a horse H We just put the shoes that were already made
LENORE,CA,THROAT THROAT
LYNNE,MT,on a horse H And that's as far as we got I mean if you would really get into it H Well as a matter of fact H this is really funny You know there isn't really any girl farriers around anywhere They're really
LENORE,CA,farrier
LYNNE,MT,H th Yeah farrier is what they're called H And the m the reason they were showing us this at college was just to get us H to know if our trimmer and shoer were_s doing it right and H plus the knowledge of knowing the bones and ligaments which we we had it in another class too we H that was kind of a double thing that we had in in another class so it was kinda review for us H well it was a review for some people depend on what time of the year you took it You know H if it was a review or not H But TSK anyway um PAR<P what was I gonna say I forgot what I was think
LENORE,CA,You said you never made the horseshoes
LYNNE,MT,gonna say P>PAR
LENORE,CA,but
LYNNE,MT,H Well w um when we put em on a horse's hoof all we do H they're already made they're round we pick out a size you know we'd like look at the horse's hoof and say okay H this is a double-aught this is an aught H this is you know what s what size and double-aught and aught are the ones that are most popular H For TSK you know the light horse You know I mean you get into the big horses the like the Clydesdales Shires that's a d a whole different thing H Or ponies that's a whole different thing H But we're talking just the regular light horses you know H And aught and aught X uh X aught and double-aught are the two sizes H Well anyway you go get your Okay this is after you trimmed em H And you go get your shoe It's already made It's already round You pick out your size H You go look and every horse's hoof is shaped different It doesn't matter every horse is gonna have a little different shape H And so what you have to do
LENORE,CA,So every every uh horseshoe is made custom-made for the horse then
LYNNE,MT,H No no H No What What we do then that's that's where the ferrier comes in H Every shoe is like you get order you know I would like a b case of double-aught shoes You'd get H The ferrier gets em You know that's the way it goes H And then TSK Our job is to shape the shoe to the horse's foot H And that it d it sounds easy but it's really hard to do I mean H some of em you have to you know like say okay say your shoe's like this H and your horse's foot is just really wide or something H Well then you have to put it on the anvil and get the shoe stretched out H well then once you stretch the shoe out well then H the two corners they go out too you know okay your shoe's like this H You stretch this out well then it's gonna make these go way out too and they get like this
LENORE,CA,Right
LYNNE,MT,H then you have to round these back you know H It's just it s it sounds easy but it's really hard to do and then H I would never do it cause I'd never trust myself to do it H I mean we had to do it
LENORE,CA,THROAT
LYNNE,MT,but it's just that people would volunteer their horses to the college because H it costs like thirty bucks to get your horse shod I mean that's just how much it costs Could you imagine all those horses out there if we had em all shod that's
LENORE,CA,How many have you got
LYNNE,MT,H thirty bucks for twenty horses
LENORE,CA,twenty
LYNNE,MT,twenty-eight horses you know H I mean Jesus that would be a th nine hundred dollars SNAP just SNAP like that SM I mean could you imagine SM H So w you know like a lot of people that have a lot of horses and stuff and that they're riding a lot they'll just H let the college kids do em For em you know H They're taking the risk of having their horse get lame but H It really never happens cause we have our s instructor right there telling us this is what you do H And it's not like there's a person that's just gung ho and goes and just H trims their feet and puts the shoe on you know you d you d you can't do that And so we have our instructor right there and we asked a million questions all the time I mean H he e he just runs around everywhere you know SWALLOW so it's H But uh P<PAR What was I gonna say PAR>P TSK Oh and it's really tiring though H And it you know like you get so I've only done like H well Hx at the end of the year now see I took the second half of the course H And right now I've probably only shod about five horses H Trimmed a lot of em H And you know what we start out with This is the grossest of everything
LENORE,CA,X What X
LYNNE,MT,H We start out H with dead horse hooves H I mean you know X the X the canneries you know and stuff you know The people that H that kill the horses for meat and stuff You know they have all these legs and stuff H And I don't know everybody
LENORE,CA,I thought they used the THROAT the horsehooves in for gelatin That's not so
LYNNE,MT,H HI You know I think they do HI I think a lot of times but then they they probably use em for everything I don't know what all they use em for H But anyway we TSK get these horse hooves from this one cannery H they they have to go a long ways to go get em like back East somewhere to get these horse hooves H For the college H They go back East and they get em and they freeze em you know H So we have this frozen horse hoof that we have to start out on cause you don't want to cripple up a H really good horse and like my first hoof H that horse would have been lame like crazy H But H it was just and oh God it's so gross because H sometimes if you get one that's been thawed out a little bit they start really stinking and stuff Oh it's the grossest thing Oh it's just so icky H HI I mean you have this HI H piece of horse HI I mean this leg that's HI oh it's just gross H And like in some of em TSK blood will spurt out you know and I mean oh H It's nothing SM H it's the grossest thing SM H And that's why that's probably why they have to make that class mandatory because at the beginning of the year it's just the it's the pits H But once you get into it it's the funnest thing and you know it's really interesting to do stuff like that H But I would have never got into that class if H there's no way if I didn't have to have it there's no way I mean H I heard everybody saying um you know like the people that took the class before H talking about VOX Oh you have to do this you have to do that there's dead horse hooves you know you gotta H and they stink VOX and all this other stuff and I was just going Q oh my God I'm never I don't want to take that class so maybe I'll wait till next year Q and then I thought no I'll get it out of the way now H And then once I got into it geez I wanna take the second half of it it was just really interesting to me you know H But Hx TSK at first it was kind of a bummer But H I'm glad I took it Really glad TSK It pays off Especially you know H twelve bucks for a trim I mean that's twelve bucks every time I can go out and trim my own horse's hooves
LENORE,CA,Right
LYNNE ,CA, You know and I wouldn't trust myself to do it with a horse that I was really using a lot or anything but the ones that are standing around H that's still twelve dollars you know I mean whether the horse being used a lot or not that's twelve bucks and H shoot I can do those you know But I always have anybody H I always have somebody that really knows what they're doing for the horses that I'm really really using TSK H But anyway TSK I wanna wait until the morning to do that because H It's just too hot in the afternoon to try to sit out there H I mean you can get just exhausted H Anyway I was gonna tell you about that the girl you know there isn't mary very many ferrier girls you know And her heart
LYNNE,MT,That do this H This summer I met one H Jorgensen's they have one shoer that comes to their house all the time they've had him for years and years and years H And I guess like in Minnesota it's real wet and stuff you know So like they really have to watch their shoes for not coming off because the hoof wall is so much softer H It's like when you're down there your hands are softer and everything you know and they're not as dry or anything H When you get back here we have dry hooves we have to watch out for like uh H like the hooves being too dry we have to put ointment on em and stuff H The Back there they're too wet H Not this time of the year because you know they've had a dry year but H usually they're too wet and that that shoe can just pull right off because it's just H the hoof wall is so soft
LENORE,CA,Yeah
LYNNE,MT,It seems weird that that's like that
LENORE,CA,X
LYNNE,MT,H you know and I nei I never knew that until I took this class either I didn't realize that in H you know if you think about it yeah if it rains a lot the horse is always wet And it's always moist and it's always on something moist
LENORE,CA,Yeah
LYNNE,MT,TSK H Sure it's gonna be softer H But I never even thought about that until I took this class So it's you know that's kinda stuff too that you think about H But anyway TSK they always have this one horseshoer and H this girl's been in this ferrier uh she's going to an actual ferrier college H They have a lot of those around a lot H And she's going to one of em and she's been going for like nine months to this one and she's still got a lot more
DORIS,MT,X Where is the uh X
LYNNE,MT,H left to go What
DORIS,MT,Where is the XX
LYNNE,MT,Oh Right here
DORIS,MT,Guess I'll put it on it's not on XX
LYNNE,MT,TSK But anyway She has um H she he's like taking her as a you know helping her out and stuff you know for the summer she's been working with him all summer H And it's really different to see a girl doing it you know you just don't see that ENV AIR_CONDITIONER_FAN_BEGINS
LYNNE,MT,at all ever H Jorgensen's have a girl or a g you know a guy they've had a guy being a horseshoer for a long time you know H And they are um TSK H there's this girl that's working with him for the summer
DORIS,MT,Unhunh
LYNNE,MT,And she's gonna be a ferrier
DORIS,MT,Yeah
LYNNE,MT,I couldn't believe it HI And she's just little HI She's a tiny girl but boy I tell you she's got arms the size of H they're huge but she must only HI What is m blowing out of there HI
DORIS,MT,Well that's what happens with that air conditioner it's just it gets dust accumulated in it see it's all over the TV
LYNNE,MT,It was just on last night how does it get dust in it already
DORIS,MT,Well I It Mae Lynne for one thing the filters are dirty because it it so been so dry And the it all comes acrost the road you know and and then it builds up real bad with H COUGH deposits out of the water
LYNNE,MT,Oh
DORIS,MT,In other words I should be change filters
LYNNE,MT,Ugh God
DORIS,MT,I know It won't last long But it sure does make a mess in the house
LYNNE,MT,Yeah it makes a mess
DORIS,MT,X I need X new filters XX
LYNNE,MT,Anyway this girl must only weigh like a hundred and ten pounds H I mean she's just a little shit and she's out there and she's got huge arms I mean she's in shape like you can't believe H She's out there just H working away And those guys are so used to it that they do it all day long you know
LENORE,CA,Mhm
LYNNE,MT,And that doesn't bother em a bit to just go out there and trim and trim and trim H And shoe and everything but for me Hx that's something I'm not used to and boy I tell you H you just sweat just rolls off of you I just H HI it's HI tiring The very at the very beginning when we first started doing it we only did like one hoof H Then we moved up to two Then we moved up to a full horse you know H And We were just slowly got in shape doing that you know H But now if I went to do that Holy smokes I'd never be able to handle it
LENORE,CA,TSK Why
LYNNE,MT,It's just it's a it's hard work It is really hard work H You're bent over and it's you know it takes like I don't know why you sweat so bad doing it either but you just oh it's just H it's just hard hard work It's H it doesn't seem like it would be but SWALLOW it is It's really takes a lot of muscles to do it too I mean a lot H Those It's hard
LENORE,CA,X You don't X get kicked a lot
LYNNE ,CA,SK I've never been kicked ever H But like it those college h is course you know like I was talking our horses are a little better than H most people's horse cause they've been around people a lot H And they they don't get by with stuff I mean we do get mad at our horses for H you know whatever they do wrong we do get mad at em TSK like I noticed H horses at college they just haven't been disciplined enough and they're just H it's like a kid they're just are ornery you know H And like they'll move around and kinda be ornery about half way but not not too bad I've never been kicked doing it at all H And that's another thing we had to learn in the class you know just had to learn our safety of H where to stand and how to stand H You have to stand like these certain ways and oh and it's a killer on your back cause you're standing like this Oh I'm sorry Berry H You're standing ENV MICROPHONE
LYNNE,MT,Whoops H You're standing like this you know H And like when you're in the back the horse's hoof lays like this right over you and you're like this working you know H This is like a hoof knife then a you know
LENORE,CA,So you're always bent over
LYNNE,MT,You're always bent over And like in the front H You stick the horse's hoof between your leg you know TSK H Kinda like that and you kinda you go like this you kinda bend down like this and you have the horse's hoof right here
LENORE,CA,It's hard on your back
LYNNE,MT,H It's really hard on your back Like I noticed that girl's back muscles were just tremendous too you know Couldn't believe it She had like on this really p kinda short shirt you know H X There's this X H I think that's cold
LENORE,CA,Just don't it's if you rub something against it it's just
LYNNE,MT,Makes a sound H Nkay
LENORE,CA,So what what were you gonna do out there today What other what other things X were you X gonna
LYNNE,MT,H Just go out and um
LENORE,CA,TSK Look at the filly
LYNNE,MT,H Yeah H I think more or less Hx it's getting about so late now Pretty much all we're gonna do is go out I don't know what her plans really are But I think pretty much just go out and take care of em and then H maybe go to that seasonal dance or whatever it is Is that what it's called
LENORE,CA,I don't know
LYNNE,MT,I don't know what it's called either H You know he said there was four guys doing that
LENORE,CA,Doing what
LYNNE,MT,The dance you know How he said there's four guys I wonder if that means like H Since there's four seasons you know I wonder if that has something to do with it
LENORE,CA,Unhunh
LYNNE,MT,since he called it a seasonal dance
LENORE,CA,XX
LYNNE,MT,H He's a pretty neat guy I thought
LENORE,CA,Yeah he spoke Crow okay H
LYNNE,MT,H I got a kick out of him when he kept saying it H See this little cat Hx H Little cat
LENORE,CA,I don't wanna see the little cat I know
LYNNE,MT,I know
LENORE,CA,that sounds like kitten
LYNNE,MT,that sounds like kit-
LENORE,CA,I don't wanna say kitten that sounds stupid
LYNNE,MT,H
LENORE,CA,H
LYNNE,MT,So she named everybody in the class except for
LENORE,CA,TSK About four people Well I think they asked for names
LYNNE,MT,Oh did they Hunh That's funny H Look at how much that air conditioner blew on that blue bag right there
LENORE,CA,Yeah I noticed on the on the case for the tape recorder too X that it's all X that it's all covered today Look right here
LYNNE,MT,Look at your cigarettes even
LENORE,CA,Look Right here Just
LYNNE,MT,Geez
LENORE,CA,just from sitting here For just a minute That's
LYNNE,MT,Look at the cigarettes
LENORE,CA,It's like ash Is it from that must be from the fires Or what
LYNNE,MT,You know maybe it is Maybe it is
LENORE,CA,Uh
LYNNE,MT,Cause that one whole day you couldn't even see or anything from H but look at your cigarettes Just sitting there
LENORE,CA,Oh yeah On the way into r from Roundup yesterday morning the radio was on And they were talking about the weather and they said H how we everybody woke up with ash all over their car today and
LYNNE,MT,In Roundup
LENORE,CA,On the way from Roundup I was listening to the radio Yesterday morning And they were talking
LYNNE,MT,And so this was probably like a Billings radio station or something like that
LENORE,CA,Yeah Unhunh
LYNNE,MT,H Is that right
LENORE,CA,And they said well everybody woke up with ashes on their car today And I guess just from the fires
DORIS,MT,Yeah it is
LYNNE,MT,H
DORIS,MT,I was telling Mae Lynne
LYNNE,MT,Hunh
DORIS,MT,Uh day before yesterday it was the most weird day I've ever seen in my entire adult life It was um the wind was blowing real hot when I first got up And it was early Real early like seven o'clock in the morning that that wind was just hot H And next thing you knew it was just overcast well the smoke all blew in Just like there was a fire right around close H And it was just dense You couldn't even hardly see very far away H Okay then it that s it just kinda blew the smoke in and then blew it out but H then it was real hazy and there was just dust particles all over and it was H you'd look at the sun and it would just look red I mean you couldn't see the sun It was just
LYNNE,MT,She said people were driving around with their lights on
DORIS,MT,Yeah And the lights were they didn't look like they were it's just from the drought and the dust you know and the smoke in the air I've never seen anything like it
LYNNE,MT,And she said like the lights looked a greenish color
DORIS,MT,Yeah They look a green XXXX
LYNNE,MT,You know how they look yellow at night you know
DORIS,MT,Yeah they just looked green It was a weird ugly ugly day Rana Lee's gonna have a baby by the way

DORIS,MT,P Rana Lee P
LYNNE,MT,Brian's wife
DORIS,MT,Brian's wife
LYNNE,MT,I didn't even know she was pregnant three months ago Of course I guess they can get big in three months
DORIS,MT,X Well I I told you X

LYNNE,MT,Rana Lee
LENORE,CA,Hm
LYNNE,MT,H H I don't know why I told you that SING Rana Lee SING H YWN She had a brother that died from asthma too YWN Seem like a lot of people I mean that's weird that I would know two people that died from asthma You know
DORIS,MT,Why don't we go
LENORE,CA,just in
DORIS,MT,except
LYNNE,MT,Just in a matter of a year's time
DORIS,MT,This washing is XXX
LENORE,CA,Really
LYNNE,MT,Yeah Her brother was like H just right out of high school H I mean you know did mom tell you about Deb at all She probably really couldn't since Genetta was there H You know she was like she was in the hospital in and out of the hospital all the time and stuff ever since she was little H she was in and out of the hospital
DORIS,MT,Who was that Debby
LYNNE,MT,Debby H I mean she was in
DORIS,MT,X
LYNNE,MT,she H loved horses so much
DORIS,MT,XXXX X stuff on it X>
LYNNE,MT,H and she was always like H she's allergic to horsehair horse sweat
LENORE,CA,Oh X
LYNNE,MT,You know stuff like that but she wouldn't quit riding em so
DORIS,MT,Well XX
LYNNE,MT,she's allergic to everything it doesn't matter
DORIS,MT,XXX was saying it didn't matter what she did
LENORE,CA,Did she ever go to a allergy doctor
LYNNE,MT,XXXX
LENORE,CA,or anybody like that
LYNNE,MT,H Oh yeah She t H well they she never did take shots Did she
DORIS,MT,No I don't know why They should've they should have gotten her
LYNNE,MT,I don't know why they didn't either
DORIS,MT,I I w always wondered about that and she was s she had such severe asthma that H I would have done a little bit more for her I think
LYNNE,MT,H If you wanna talk about somebody tired that girl that girl couldn't walk down to the street and back without taking a nap And me and mom always accused her of being lazy You know because she was just HI all she did was sleep HI
LENORE,CA,She sounded like she had more problems than
LYNNE,MT,and now that when we think about it she probably wasn't really lazy she's probably just exhausted I mean H you know if you think about it we like take everything for granted We take our air for granted You know Then somebody like that every little breath is like and effort to em d and you know and if I had to go through an effort just in breathing all the time H
DORIS,MT,Well Debby got
LYNNE,MT,I would be tired too
DORIS,MT,Debby got to the point where all she would do is when she did you know every just really often she would go H to try to get enough air in and her they had an autopsy done on her And her heart was just hard on one side from H labored breathing all of her life It had just labored her heart so bad H She actually died of a heart attack
LYNNE,MT,She did
DORIS,MT,Yeah
LYNNE,MT,They did have an autopsy done on her
DORIS,MT,Yes It surprised me But they they did And it was actually a
LYNNE,MT,And her heart was hard
DORIS,MT,cardiac arrest Mhm H One side of her heart was just hard from the muscle the muscle was just hard from just labored breathing
LYNNE,MT,Geez
DORIS,MT,X trying to breathe all the time X
LYNNE,MT,That's just sick Doris Yeah we thought she was just lazy and kind of worthless but we didn't realize what she was going through
LYNNE,MT,And you know Hx maybe that's another reason why she didn't really H maybe mom she kinda knew about all this stuff And maybe that's why she didn't really pay that much attention to Amanda I mean not because H I mean it seems like she'd pay more attention to her but maybe it's because she wanted to have a little fun in her life too and knew it wasn't gonna H last forever for her You know I mean I guess like right before she died and stuff she's like telling her mom like well if I go I want this here and I want that there and You know just little things
LENORE,CA,Is Amanda her kid or
LYNNE,MT,Yeah
LENORE,CA,Oh
DORIS,MT,she had a little three-year-old daughter
LYNNE,MT,It's just too bad I just hope Orville and Genetta get that little girl
DORIS,MT,Oh they won't there's no
LYNNE,MT,Are they even trying
DORIS,MT,X They can't X They want her three months out of the year but they have no legal grounds I mean You know he is the legal father and there's not much they can do
LENORE,CA,X Oh X she was divorced
DORIS,MT,Mhm

FRAN,LA,If you have a studio apartment you're stuck with it
SEAN,CO,
ALICE,PA,For the rest of your life Like herpes

SEAN,CO,
FRAN,LA,if you have a one-bedroom it has to have something kinda going for it Or you're gonna be sorta stuck You could be stuck with it H Um two-bedrooms and up are are f easy to se easier to sell
ALICE,PA,Cause Beth You know my friend
SEAN,CO,X Eddie's still in New York or some other state X

BERNARD,CA,That ch
FRAN,LA,And there was an awful lot Because they soared so high that area had H less zoning uh

ALICE,PA,Do you like living in New York

FRAN,LA,Yeah
ALICE,PA,Wow
FRAN,LA,I did take five years off I went to uh Florida which was a terrible mistake We needed a vacation and we accidentally moved instead
ALICE,PA,Oh
FRAN,LA,And then we realized that Well The first year we were there we visited New York six times and we looked at each other and said
BERNARD,CA,
FRAN,LA,VOX God we certainly do go back up there a lot what do you think that's about VOX You know and we were just getting increasingly bored down there and H you know you get occupied fixing up a house and that's kinda fun and then
ALICE,PA,Where in Florida were you
FRAN,LA,On the Gulf Coast Fort Myers Beach We had a nice house right on the sea
SEAN,CO,In Yeah
FRAN,LA,Right on the sea

FRAN,LA,But we didn't like it At all And so that's when we said well let's not do anything precipitous like we did moving down here H before we race back to New York let's look around a little bit So we hit the road And we stayed out for a couple years
SEAN,CO,Two years they'd been looking
FRAN,LA,looking all over
SEAN,CO,for other places
ALICE,PA,Looking round Really And
FRAN,LA,Unhunh Round the US

BERNARD,CA,Oh if New York's under your skin watch out
FRAN,LA,Yeah it's like a drug
BERNARD,CA,You can't get out It It is
FRAN,LA,You're finished

SEAN,CO,You know
BERNARD,CA,Quit that crying
FRAN,LA,Well New Yorkers are extremely candid And also very emotionally accessible Which is not the reputation we have outside Of New York H But you know I mean if you ask a cab driver if he speaks English Okay let's assume you got one who speaks English H And he's sorta been a little bit acculturated you know H But if you g Not not the Pakistanis fresh off the off the boat

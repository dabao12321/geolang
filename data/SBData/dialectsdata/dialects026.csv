PATTY,KS,I Just wanted to go over the changes in the schedule H Um originally we were going to require the um request for statement of interest and qualifications to come back to uh twenty North Clark Street on April seventh H Um but the um coordinating council felt that it was wise to give the community more time a weekend two days to uh augment whatever application people were gonna submit
AUD,NA,THROAT
PATTY,KS,so the due date is changed from April seventh to April eleventh at noon And you can drop off those proposals at twenty North Clark Street H Um the same process will continue but for the changes in the time at the time that you drop off your proposal you will be scheduled for a uh public meeting where you will be given a chance and an opportunity to present your H uh proposal H Um right now we're looking at April fifteenth which is a Friday and s and April sixteenth as the uh date for that public presentation and we don't know where that will be held or what time that will be held but we'll make sure that everyone gets noticed about that H During April seventeen to the twenty-third the coordinating council will identify the empowerments on location H and uh during the week of uh April twenty-fifth
AUD,NA,COUGH
PATTY,KS,there will be a city-wide meeting to present the selected empowerment zone H uh to go over how that zone was selected and uh the place date and time for that meeting will also be announced H Um from May second to June third the strategic plan for the empowerment zone
AUD,NA,COUGH
PATTY,KS,will be developed with the community and during the week of June sixth um a public presentation of on the uh empowerment zone application and the strategic plan will presented be presented again H the place date and time will be announced H um and on June thirtieth that's the drop dead date um when we will send the application for selection by HUD as an empowerment zone for Chicago H Um is if there are no other questions um we can yes sir
GRANT,NA,X I have X a question
PATTY,KS,TSK Yeah
GRANT,NA,Worst case scenario After we submit em the uh the proposal application uh human beings being what they are organizations being what they are what will the coordinating council what does the city propose to do when there's a hue and cry from those who attempting to empower themselves and combined with coupled with those who are seeking more power Who say unfair this wasn't done right according to our perspective or this that and the other
PATTY,KS,that would be the worst case scenario
GRANT,NA,X worst case scenario
AUD,NA,COUGH COUGH
GRANT,NA,What can the city what what can the coordinating council or what's gonna be p be in place to listen to all the criticisms
AUD,NA,COUGH
GRANT,NA,all of the disappointments at not being selected so that let's say optimistically there are some good ideas some oversight or something that can be corrected hopefully that's of minor proportion So that we can still keep the city running smoothly and becoming more and more beautiful
PATTY,KS,I don't know if that issue has been discussed by the um coordinating council I think it's a legitimate issue um I w y would be willing to take that back to have them discuss that but I mean the worst thing would be for HUD not to recognize that this is a c collaborative effort a partnership between the community the city the business community and the neighborhoods H and I mean it wouldn't bode well for Chicago to get an empowerment zone if if everyone were not supportive and on board So I mean that answers your question I don't know what the coordinating council's role in that case would be But we'll definitely take that message back X on that question I X
GRANT,NA,May I propose that the coordinating council consider my individual worst case scenario and any other worst case scenarios that they collectively X might come up with X Notwithstanding Paul XX's suggestion that the empowerment zone moneys a hundred million CTA green line three-hundred million be utilized effectively and efficiently to get a bigger bang for the buck
PATTY,KS,kay XX
ROSE,NA,I just wanted to say that there's also some other opportunities for um organizations that are new in the networking process and I think that the more meetings you can attend and the more organizations that hear your voice
AUD,NA,THROAT
ROSE,NA,the better There's uh a networking meeting going on on Friday at nine thirty in the morning at the X Mega X Center And it's free It's it's a it's a group of assist and nonassist agencies um organizations like CRCC the X Mega X Center the COBCU Women's Business Development Center Small Business Development Center I couldn't even begin to mention the list because there's about twenty-five different assist and nonassist agencies on there But I think that anybody who belongs to an organization um that has any type of connection with the city it would be good to
GRANT,NA,Twenty-sixth where
ROSE,NA,This one is Friday at nine thirty at the X Mega X Center
GRANT,NA,The X bank X right That's the X bank X X X
ROSE,NA,It's one o five West Adams on the seventh floor
GRANT,NA,At what time
ROSE,NA,Nine I'm sorry it's nine to ten-thirty
GRANT,NA,Okay I I I X I have a clue that she gave me but I'll make arrangements on it X
ROSE,NA,Mhm
PATTY,KS,The lady in the yellow sweater
KAREN,NA,Actually I was X again X I was trying to reframe his concerns in the best case scenario The Alderman spoke to you feel that somehow the process that has been established Um could divide the city Best case scenario would be the provisions were made such that the ideas that come out and the collaborations that come out of this process and let them continue Whether or not the city of Chicago is designated for anything That that some reassurance of what comes out of it
AUD,NA,THROAT
KAREN,NA,could be um somehow taken into consideration and continue to be fostered from the city of Chicago
PATTY,KS,I think the city is I mean I know the city is committed to that and I know that that has come up at the i um TSK H the coordinating council meeting A desire to work continue to work
AUD,NA,COUGH
PATTY,KS,with people no matter what happens on this issue and there's been some discussion about H um other kinds of funds that could be put towards implementing uh uh areas plans in areas that are not selected
AUD,NA,THROAT
PATTY,KS,um so I think there is a commitment to do that and that that certainly has been the spirit H of the um coordinating council X You and then Paul X
DAN,NA,Um I've got uh three questions for you Uh and I suppose your response is gonna just kinda XX on there but first um does the city have any idea how many uh requests they're gonna how many proposals that they're gonna be getting Do you have an estimation
PATTY,KS,No
DAN,NA,So
AUD,NA,X At least one X
DAN,NA,
MANY,NA,LAUGHTER
DAN,NA,I'm sure Um s-
AUD,NA,THROAT
DAN,NA,Uh well that kind of leads into my my next question I think touches on these people's questions as far as H it seemed like it would behoove us all if there were some kind of consensus building process before uh X this went on and X So what people are saying they're having community meetings community organiza community uh group meetings But uh it's from what I understand of this empowerment zone process the idea is to really involve things on a g grassroots level
AUD,NA,COUGH
DAN,NA,And my two concerns on par as far as participation goes are one that a and I voiced this concern with X elder Jarret X when uh last month at the uh Washington or uh Washington Library Center when they uh XX X the person introduced X that And that is simply throwing this out into the community and saying that you expect the community to be able to respond Community groups to be able to respond to you H Is I think it at l at least not an effective uh instrument for for getting this done Uh
AUD,NA,COUGH
PATTY,KS,I think that that's the expectation of the
DAN,NA,It doesn't it doesn't address
PATTY,KS,of the XXXX
DAN,NA, It doesn't address the fact that one community organizations H um and many are of them being service providers do not necessarily have the same goals in mind as community residents do They've got different agendas they've got different priorities they've got different purposes than members of the r the community themselves H Um the second thing is that people who do not live directly inside H the areas that are gonna be part of the empowerment zones they've got an overriding concern in this because H as Mr Pollack said A hundred million dollars is just gonna be a drop in the bucket To be able to make these things work and especially to make them work over a ten year process H that this is calling for there're gonna be a lot of community resources s uh from the federal government from the state county and city that are gonna need to be marshalled they're gonna need to be reallocated to this area And to be able to have a consensus not just within the empowerment zone but within the city itself if these services Are gonna be provided and maintained over the ten years through different administrations through different aldermen political processes involved these people are not being brought into the decision-making process beforehand And I think this speaks to these people's concern H that
PATTY,KS,These people meaning who The
DAN,NA,I I heard several people this this r I don't know their names So I'll just have to woman in yellow gentleman here in the glasses that there's gonna be h uh earlier that very first speaker gentleman uh Ed Smith Uh that you're gonna be receiving a number of proposals and you say you don't know how many I don't know how you're gonna have twenty-eight thirty-two people that you said on a coordinating council read maybe a hundred proposals within a week's time and be able to arrive at one selected empowerment zone it seems to me that it be much more beneficial if the entire community as a whole was brought into this process and this is what I'm bringing up is the idea of participation True community-based citizen participation would involve ongoing series of meeting that I would think that the coordinating council would be promoting would be organizing and directing on an ngoing .e+ven nightly basis
AUD,NA,COUGH COUGH COUGH
PATTY,KS,That's not exactly grassroot planning
DAN,NA,to be
PATTY,KS,either
DAN,NA,Right
PATTY,KS,H um grassroot planning is when people get out in the community and organize
DAN,NA,But they need a forum
PATTY,KS,and do the work
DAN,NA,they need H if this woman here today did not speak up
PAT,NA,Y and
PATTY,KS,Let me answer your question
DAN,NA,All these people here would not even know a meeting was going on
PATTY,KS,Let me try to respond to your question sir So what you're suggesting is not a grassroot in my opinion a grassroot process H Secondly the the the reality is we only have till June thirtieth to submit an application A really a true strategic planning process grassroot takes many more months than that Many more years than we have
DAN,NA,XX
PATTY,KS,Okay H So we have to do the best that we can do given the time that we have
DAN,NA,And all I'm saying is I'm saying that I don't believe a forum is being presented for community groups to I mean some people are finding out about this for the first time tonight some people are finding out about meetings that are going on with other groups for the first time tonight H this is not being promoted by the city this is not being H publicized as a forum as a
PATTY,KS,It has been promoted it has been publicized I don't know
DAN,NA,I'll tell you right now that the leading Hx onprofit affordable housing provider on the West Side isn't even involved with this He said he hasn't even XXX PRIDE has not even been contacted by those groups on the West Side
PATTY,KS,Well let me tell you I've worked with PRIDE and I had a meeting with PRIDE last week they know about it
DAN,NA,I didn't say they didn't know about it I said they're not being they're not being contacted by y as far as being brought into a network for this I'm I'm sorry I'm not trying to be confrontational Okay I'm trying to raise issues and concerns Alright
PATTY,KS,Although I do think
DAN,NA,The second my second qu
PATTY,KS,that the organization has a responsibility If they're interested in this
DAN,NA,Undoubtedly Undoubtedly
PATTY,KS,And they care about empowerment of th of their  constituency
DAN,NA,Undoubtedly
PATTY,KS,to get involved in the process and find a way to make that happen XX
DAN,NA,M my second question would be on the process the city obviously's got its own priorities it's got um funds already allocated in budget it's got areas designated that they would like to see worked on and my question as far as the process is c way the selection goes are um what w which is gonna drive which How much weight are gonna be given to um proposals which dovetail into existing programs that the city has or that the city is intending on implementing in certain areas and how much is the city willing to bend and say I will g we are gonna forego these uh scheduled or proposed projects to be able to dovetail into empowerment zones
GRANT,NA,What's being said Patty is when is the city going to present say for instance its overall plan for conducting the city So everyone can see their seat in the auditorium or their place around the table and how long will they have to wait for their turn for development when will their interests be served so this empowerment zone it simply seems to me is opening a Pandora's Box
PATTY,KS,Go ahead Well to let me answer your question in terms of the um uh proposed plans I mean right now the um coordinating council is making the selection based on the information that is received from the community And obviously there there are other issues to look at for example um organizations that may be involved in um current work their ability new organizations new ideas H I mean all that is getting is thrown in the pot H and I don't think that any community that has an existing plan has a leg up on any one else who has a new idea that may not be part of a plan
DAN,NA,Uh are they explaining the uh for example I don't know if Londa White is here s uh theoretical at a uh a uh community meeting last month in which uh a lot of uh selection criteria were uh drawn up I was wondering if is the council gonna absorb that into the selection process also
PATTY,KS,The council has uh received a copy of that and the council has seen portions of uh of the Seaway principles H some of those principles have been are included in what we have tonight
AUD,NA,COUGH
PATTY,KS,Others are really principles for the zone itself H and how the makeup of the zone will be And that is going to be handed out to the uh Coordinating Council this Thursday
DAN,NA,Uh m m my third question is on the final program I think this gentleman again spoke very very adequately to it um it seems to me again this idea of building consensus That if we're able to make this a program like this work over such a long time That the city and in fact it's stated in the uh uh proposal the uh HUD application proposal that the uh governing body making the application must provide a ssurance and evidence that this uh uh empowerment zone plan is gonna be adhered to and implemented and it seems to me that one of the most fundawen fundamental and best ways to have this done would be for the city to come up with a comprehensive plan
AUD,NA,COUGH COUGH
DAN,NA,that follows guidelines that would ensure that what's happening in the empowerment zone is indeed the seed program that's gonna be followed and be able to be dis distributed to other areas of the city and and built on in other areas of the city does the city have any uh plans uh any any hope of coming up with a comprehensive plan for developing the city
PATTY,KS,We do not have a comprehensive plan for the city of Chicago
DAN,NA,Does the city have
PATTY,KS,We have
DAN,NA,any hopes of
PATTY,KS,policies for development and we have been identifying H places that have plans and trying to get things done H A comprehensive plan requires H uh the infusion of many many dollars much more than is available you know within the city budget to implement a plan and at this point we are looking at ways to be strategic in how we invest our money and the empowerment zone is an .e+ is an example of an of an area where we are going to do some strategic planning along with the community which will lead to implementation and investing in our plan
DAN,NA,Correct Would you say it's only we only have policy guidelines and when when administrations change policies change What I'm talking about is that cities that we are competing against Seattle San Antonio Minneapolis they've got comprehensive plans for the development of their cities And that
PATTY,KS,some of them do and some of them do not
DAN,NA,The ones that I just mentioned do
PATTY,KS,
DAN,NA,Alright
PATTY,KS,Hx
DAN,NA,And my point is
PATTY,KS,Some of them do
DAN,NA,that
PATTY,KS,and some of them do not
DAN,NA,The ones that I just mentioned do And my my point is that it seems to us that it it it seems to me that it would give us as Chicago H a much better footing with government if we said that we had a comprehensive plan that was gonna ensure that these things are going to be
PATTY,KS,Well sir
DAN,NA,XX XX X
PATTY,KS,considering that our plan is due June thirtieth H and considering that between now and then we will not have a comprehensive plan for the city of Chicago H um I'm not quite sure where to go with your question
AUD,NA,COUGH COUGH
PATTY,KS,Oh I'm s I'm sorry
DEREK,NA,Oh
BERNIE,NA,go ahead go ahead
PATTY,KS,X Bernie X
BERNIE,NA,I ha X I just wanted to make a friendly remind X
PATTY,KS,X Hx I'm sorry Derek
DEREK,NA,Um My name's Derek Williams I'm I'm with the HORN association of men and uh I I think we need to recognize that uh uh this is an opportunity and it's not a threat Uh consensus do not build themselves And and if we just be perfectly honest with each other the only reason that we're all in this room is because we heard about a hundred million dollars
MANY,NA,LAUGHTER
DEREK,NA,And that's what everybody's worried about Uh it's impossible for any city to have a comprehensive plan because we don't have comprehensive people First of all And I think we just need to given the information that's out there we need to try to make it as meaningful as we can to our constituents Uh be honestly speaking with you uh I come from an organization with five hundred members and empowerment zone has absolutely no meaning to just about eighty percent of our population For the simple reason we get caught up in in in all of the rhetoric um we we constantly challenge each other and I I don't think this is the time for that I I think we should be trying to focus on the information that's available and and and meet the challenge And I and I think we can do that And in and again this is an opportunity to meet the challenge
MANY,NA,APPLAUSE
PATTY,KS,Thanks Derek that's why I guess you're sitting in the front row H Um Paul
PAUL,NA,Derek I I appreciate following you
DEREK,NA,Thanks
PAUL,NA,Well see I'd've been kinda frustrated trying to say what you said some of it I'd like to just for a couple minutes set the record straight on what empowerment zones are and what they are not according to my own understanding The empowerment zones were implemented under the Clinton administration They did not start under the Clinton administration They started in the state of Illinois as enterprise zones back in the eighties The difference between empowerment zones and enterprise zones is that the federal government for twelve years Congress never did approve enterprise zones at the federal level By the time they were approved Congress in its wisdom attached funding criteria and shifted the name from enterprise zones to empowerment zones For the record I do not live in CHA I am not homeless I do not transport myself on CTA properties I'm a veteran so I do not go to county hospitals I abide by the law so I'm not in county jail I have attended several colleges I think successfully they think unsuccessfully so I do not need the public education system in Chicago But I do know who does_/uz need em The homeless and people not in public housing Public housing because one we're getting ready to tear them all down What are we gonna do with it The city has no right X would be in a fight X X we need X to try and tell me what my block needs When my block decides what it needs and presents its plan to the city then the city can take its logical legal jurisprudence course of identifying what resources it has and make em available The empowerment zones what are by legislation to be planned by with and for those most in need of empowering It don't mention those agencies most in need This is not the entitlement programs H See the entitlement programs is what has turned the West Side H into a damn desert of oasis and poverty Because the West Side was planned for CHA was planned for The city has put together in a aggregate sum H the map that is about two pages H that shows you where the poorest folks live If you are an agency that is involved in those areas take the opportunity to find out what those people need and deliver the proposal If you are an agency that is outside of those areas of the census track that each of you have then change your location do like Reagan said and move with your feet into the area This is no you know three card X Molly X here We already know where the most MRC empower less people are MRC Get busy Patty asked a question earlier I have chose not to do it but out of necessity I'm gonna ask you to walk through this this is where the poor folks live This is where your tax dollars are going H And this is why you get upset every time the city launches a project H because you say it comes in over budget This is where the state has roads going on This is where county hospital has roads going on H So as far as I'm concerned H if the city did anything more than what it was doing H I would file a grievance with the Department of Justice to say that they were in violation of the legislation The legislation says that those who have nothing are either to be courted by those who have something H or left alone so that they can develop their own plan and be responsible for their success or their failure That to me is the empowerment zone Anything else is a contradiction Malcolm X we sitting in the college named after him H he said by whatever means necessary H So by whatever means necessary it takes for you to get X gautonomous X H touched contagious H in in love with poor folks is what is gonna take to keep your agencies empowered
MANY,NA,APPLAUSE
PATTY,KS,Thank you Paul Um before we close we have uh several members of the Coordinating Council here who I'd like to recognize and see if they want to add anything before we leave uh here tonight H Um we have Sproule White who is the executive director of the Chicago Jobs Council um Wanda White who is the executive director of the Community Workshop on Economic Development
AUD,NA,COUGH
PATTY,KS,H and Ted Wysaki who is the executive director of uh CANDO the Chicago Association of Neighborhood Development Organizations and also Frank Grossman was here H from Continental Bank And also the chair of the capital improvement advisory committee Do you wanna say anything X Okay

FRED,CA,Break up
RICHARD,CA,separate but it possibly was for the better cause they they didn't feel comfortable with us living together anyhow
FRED,CA,Yeah right that's not looked on too good hunh
RICHARD,CA,No So w what they what they probably think is you know that we still have a lot of love for each other H That moving out was the best thing
FRED,CA,But sh
RICHARD,CA,until we both are ready for marriage and if she still loves me and I still love her and H we wanna get married there's still the chance of us getting back together and getting married this time

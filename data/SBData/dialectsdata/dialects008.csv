RICKIE,CA,Yes The MRC whole entire time MRC

REBECCA,CA,Tell the jury that
RICKIE,CA,Okay Hx
REBECCA,CA,That's I mean that's great
RICKIE,CA,He just alright
REBECCA,CA,Um Because that's what he does
RICKIE,CA,Okay
REBECCA,CA,And that's his way H of drawing your attention to him
RICKIE,CA,Mhm
REBECCA,CA,because if somebody's doing that to you there's no way you're gonna you know just totally ignore them
RICKIE,CA,Yeah
REBECCA,CA,cause you're always going to wanna keep H them in your peripheral vision
RICKIE,CA,SNIFF
REBECCA,CA,at least
RICKIE,CA,Yeah
ARNOLD,MI,Mhm
REBECCA,CA,to make sure where they are
RICKIE,CA,Mhm Yeah Cause I was you know I didn't know what he was gonna do
REBECCA,CA,Yeah
RICKIE,CA,or anything so H
REBECCA,CA,so um part of our burden is to prove that he's deliberately doing th that he has the specific intent to draw your attention to him
RICKIE,CA,Okay
REBECCA,CA,H So let them know that he was doing that
RICKIE,CA,Okay Alright
REBECCA,CA,Um okay So then and then he sort of pulled the paper aside and he's still staring at you
RICKIE,CA,Yeah Unhunh still staring and H just you know and then but when uh uh like you come to a stop see that's all through the tunnel H You know that's a long like about
REBECCA,CA,Mhm
RICKIE,CA,five minute ride or something A couple of minutes ride H and we got to like Embarcadero H PAPER he would just you know go like this you know PAPER before anyone got on and wait and then just do the same thing X until X I had to get off at my stop
REBECCA,CA,TSKH Tell the jury about that too because that indicates that he knew what he was doing was wrong
RICKIE,CA,Hm Oh okay
REBECCA,CA,and if there was a chance that any man might walk by
RICKIE,CA,y Mhm
REBECCA,CA,H You know I had another case or I have a pr report from another case where H um he wa he was crouched down and doing it
RICKIE,CA,Mhm
REBECCA,CA,and then when a man would walk by he'd sit up
RICKIE,CA,Yeah
REBECCA,CA,H And you know do nothing and then once the man was through the doors then he'd go back X X doing it
RICKIE,CA,Yeah Okay
REBECCA,CA,So H Um okay so then you got off
RICKIE,CA,H Hx
REBECCA,CA,at your stop
RICKIE,CA,Yeah

RICKIE,CA,Well Hx P<X it was like X>P Hx CRY s I don't know sorry H
ARNOLD,MI,X You X doing alright
RICKIE,CA,SNIFF just I don't know like disgusted you know wh why I really wanted to report it this time because SOB it was like summertime SOB
REBECCA,CA,Unhunh
RICKIE,CA,and the kids You know the kids and everything
REBECCA,CA,Yeah
RICKIE,CA,that's what I was scared of because I know how uh I was you know a victim of you know abuse like that or X X SOB SNIFF I just you know I just That's what I was think the very first time I reported it was just like this dirty old man just that that
REBECCA,CA,Yeah
RICKIE,CA,SNIFF And this time it was during the summer and there was lots of kids SNIFF and um I just felt like you know upset You know
REBECCA,CA,Yeah
RICKIE,CA,and I just you know SNIFF I just felt upset
REBECCA,CA,Okay
RICKIE,CA,You know n CRY
REBECCA,CA,Tell the jury that Um it's it's really important that they understand
RICKIE,CA,SNIFF
REBECCA,CA,the feelings that go through you when sombody does something like that to you
RICKIE,CA,
REBECCA,CA,cause
RICKIE,CA,SNIFF
REBECCA,CA,H my one concern about this case is H um that some people may have the attitude of
RICKIE,CA,SNIFF
REBECCA,CA,Q well he never touched you
RICKIE,CA,Mhm
REBECCA,CA,he didn't make any verbal threats to you H it's no big deal Q
RICKIE,CA,SNIFF
REBECCA,CA,H And especially I have some young single men on my jury panel
RICKIE,CA,Mhm
REBECCA,CA,H And I my worry is that they don't relate to what a woman feels when something like that is happening
RICKIE,CA,Mhm
REBECCA,CA,because their experience would be totally different H if a man exposes himself
RICKIE,CA,SNIFF
REBECCA,CA,which a man would never do that
RICKIE,CA,Mhm
REBECCA,CA,Because
RICKIE,CA,SNIFF
REBECCA,CA,H number one they pick out I think more vulnerable people
RICKIE,CA,Mhm
REBECCA,CA,H But if um a man were to be exposed to they would laugh or you know be disgusted
RICKIE,CA,Mhm
REBECCA,CA,H or be mad H but they wouldn't necessarily feel
RICKIE,CA,SNIFF
JUNE,CA,KNOCK_KNOCK_KNOCK
REBECCA,CA,scared or threatened
RICKIE,CA,Unhunh
JUNE,CA,Hi
REBECCA,CA,Hi

RICKIE,CA,I went upstairs to the BART and told them and I tried to tell them what train it was H and I just H I was still kind of like shocked so I I was like Q well I have to go cause I have to make an appointment Q but I did tell someone I said I'll be back to make a report or whatever I had to do H and then there was a different person down there and when I called the BART police they said Q oh no one's even said anything to us Q you know and uh
REBECCA,CA,Yeah
RICKIE,CA,SNIFF That was that and then I think uh couple of days after one of the uh detectives H called me and then I made a report He wanted to see if I can ID him first and then we just made a report and he said he'll submit it and everything

PHIL,IL,Cool H Alright folks Hx Well alreet hx well alroot hx well alright H By now I'm sure you're wondering about the different things that I have on the table here but first H I would like to talk to you about these three items I have here H some ice in a pan H water in this glass and steam rising from this pot H Now I would like to ask you how these three things Tell me please H How are they all alike H These three things This ice here in this pan H This water in this glass and the steam rising from this pot just yell it out we are informal here yes H Correct They are all forms of water This ice here of course is water H I told you there was water in this glass and you have all seen water boil at home so you are familiar with steam H But now let's try to figure out how they're different we'll look at temperature H first And the temperature of this water here the ice is H about uh twenty-four n_woo Nineteen degrees Very cold H The temperature of this w water here is sixty-four degrees H the temperature of this steam is PAR I know it's hotter than that PAR Yeah it's about a hundred and eleven degrees Okay H Hx Fahrenheit Okay H Oh and by the way guys what do we call something that's hard like this ice here or a table or a rock H We call it a
MANY,NA,Solid
PHIL,IL,H Very good You should g you should be a choir You should go out on the road there like yeah H
AUD,NA,We are
PHIL,IL,H Y Oh well I'm glad to meet you H Please give me your itinerary after the show Yes H Yes Of course we call it a sholids A solid And a solid has one shape H The shape that it starts out with H And what do we call something that you that you can splish splash Take a bath in Anything wet like soda or milk
MANY,NA,Liquid
PHIL,IL,You're not gonna let me finish are you H Yes we call it a
AUD,NA,Liquid
PHIL,IL,Very good And a liquid can change its shape H to f completely fill the bottom of whatever container you put it in H And finally what do we call something that's loose and floating around like this steam here H Or a cloud or the air we breathe we call it a
MANY,NA,Gas
PHIL,IL,H Correct a gas And a gas completely fills whatever shape container H you put it in H And so how do you get water to change H from a solid H to a liquid to a gas and back and forth
AUD,NA,Add energy
PHIL,IL,H Woo I like the way he expressed that Never before have I heard it H add or subtract energy or H heat H change the temperature basically Correct Alright Well folks now I'm going to show you something else that happens H When you change the temperature and that's where these H VOX balloons VOX come in H I have here H a number of balloons but l let's see how many of these balloons I can fit H VOX into this little itty-bitty container here VOX Well H everybody count together This would be
AUD,NA,There's a XX in there
PHIL,IL,H you think well okay w th th H I'm glad I never saw d Citizen Cane with you VOX Rosebud is a sled VOX H Okay Well H let's all count together folks that was
AUD ,IL,ne
AUD,NA,One
PHIL,IL,H very good One balloon going into the H little container here And this would be
MANY,NA,Two
PHIL,IL,H two Very good counting there Two Excellent Two balloons going into the H little container here H VOX Ah VOX they're not fitting in so easily H VOX Oh no VOX H So hopefully I can fit all balloons into this little container here
AUD,NA,X XX XXXXXX
PHIL,IL,H Oh stop guessing at what this is H Let's have some suspense here Come on H Alright And this would be
MANY,NA,Three
PHIL,IL,H Three Very good Three balloons going onto the the little container there Three balloons Three yes the balloon trinity H And now this would be
AUD ,IL,ight
AUD ,IL,
AUD,NA,Four
PHIL,IL,Four Very good At first he was confused but then he figured it out H Everybody tell him what this is it's
AUD,NA,Seven
PHIL,IL,H VOX it's four VOX H Boy you people didn't watch enough Sesame Street as a child H This would be
MANY,NA,Five
PHIL,IL,H Thank you very much yes SING Five swollen balloons SING In H In H Down Down VOX Ah ah VOX H Okay H And this would be
MANY,NA,Six
PHIL,IL,H Six good And let's do this uh let's add some complexities to this here let's do it in another language H In Spanish it would be
AUD ,IL, Ocho L
AUD,NA,L Seis L
PHIL,IL,H L S seis N Ocho L Oh my gosh H I'm afraid for our nation H Okay well and this would be
AUD,NA,L Siete L
PHIL,IL,H thank you H Seven Right Seven Okay H And finally this would be
AUD ,IL,ight
AUD,NA,L Ocho L
PHIL,IL,eight or L ocho L in Spanish and uh L huit L in French thank you very much H I thought you were telling me your breakfast What you had for b But no H L Huit L Very good Oh my gosh H eight balloons into this little container here I bet you're wondering r how that happened
AUD ,IL, You popped two X
AUD,NA,There's a hole <X in it X>
PHIL,IL,H well there's a hole no if you're thinking there's a hole think again Because H there's no hole in the counter at all H
AUD ,IL,ull em out
AUD,NA,You slowed down the molecules
PHIL,IL,Well la duh dah dih duh duh you're getting a little ahead of me son H Let's all figure it out together
AUD,NA,X You popped them X
PHIL,IL,H And we can get a better idea of what's happening to the balloons if we go back and look at the water again VOX No I did not pop them VOX H You're What y what Y Do you heckle every scientific person This is really terrible H I'm gonna take some of this hot H water here and pour it into this H flask here SWALLOW And put a balloon over the top of the flask H VOX Ah VOX H Alright And now I will heat up this water Using H VOX my Bunsen H burner VOX Hx H Does it use real Bunsen Is that what you're asking me H Alright here we go There we go H Alright I'm using the fire now to heat up the water but let's H behave like scientists now and watch and observe and take note of what we see H Okay TSK H Now Folks What do we see Well if we look very closely H we can see H condensation here H On the sides of this flask and steam Rising up from the water Going up into the balloon H making the balloon blow up Woo don't want too much heat there H Oh we can also start to see H bubbles in the water H The water that was sitting at the bottom of this flask H turned into a gas H That had enough force H to fill up H this balloon H That's what we call boiling folks and I'm sure you do too Turning from a liquid H into H a gas H Now if I took the t balloon if I took the balloon off the top of this flask here and put the water into the freezer H what do you think would happen to the water H It would freeze and turn into a
AUD,NA,Solid
PHIL,IL,H Solid correct But it would still be water Yes you're right H Whether it's a solid a liquid or a gas So let's think about what water is made up of Well water is made up of atoms H VOX Yeah VOX Everything is made up of atoms H Solids H liquids gasses Now in water H two atoms of what ato uh element Yes
AUD,NA,Hydrogen
PHIL,IL,H Very good hydrogen H and one atom of what
AUD,NA,Oxygen
PHIL,IL,Oxygen I know you wanted to say it but he's my pet H Okay
AUD,NA,VOX X VOX
PHIL,IL,H TSK A all these atoms combine to form a molecule of water H And that's what a molecule is folk A group of atoms H hanging out Having a good time together H And they call the water molecule aich two o Alright So TSK Folks TSK H How do you suppose the molecules in this water PAR goodbye guys I H I'll miss you PAR H
AUD,NA,
PHIL,IL,How do you suppose the molecules in this water when it's ice are different from the molecules in the water H when it's a liquid and different still from the water H from the molecules in the water when it's steam
AUD,NA,X Fast X
PHIL,IL,Do you know H Yes
AUD,NA,They're not moving XXX
PHI,NA, H That's right it's th it's movement my friends You see all molecules move Not just in water H but in everything in the universe H VOX Even you The molecules are moving VOX H But to get a better understanding of how those molecules interact H let's pretend these ping-pong balls here H are molecules H Well folks H In a solid H like this ice here Or a table H The molecules are moving H very slowly ENV MACHINE_STARTS
PHI,NA, Alright And they're very close together in fact they're in a v MRC joined uniform state MRC H Okay they move very coolly slowly and that's what it's like H in a solid Like the ice But in a liquid ENV MACHINE_LOUDER
PHI,NA, H the molecules are moving a little more quickly Okay So you have some fluidity of movement within a fixed volume H Okay they're a little more further apart there H but in a gas ENV MACHINE_LOUDER
PHI,NA, VOX look at that H They're moving very quickly indeed Alright VOX H They're moving so fast they completely fill the shape container ENV MACHINE_STOPS
PHIL,IL,That's what it's like in a gas VOX And temperature is a measurement of how fast or slow H molecules are moving VOX So if you have H VOX slow moving molecules VOX H what temperature do you have people H Yes cold or low temperature H And if you have fast moving molecules what type of temperature do you have
MANY,NA,Hot
PHIL,IL,H VOX Hot or high temperature VOX H You're right H But not every substance becomes a solid H a liquid and a gas at the same temperatures H as water does H And that brings us back to the mystery H VOX of our disappearing balloons VOX Now inside this container here into which our balloons HI<VOX ah VOX>HI H TSK I am losing my spheres TSK H Inside this container into which our balloons have disappeared I have a liquid H I'm going to take some of that liquid and examine it much in the same way that I did H the water VOX H Yeah VOX Alright guys H Let's watch now and see what occurs H I'm going to pour this liquid into this flask here H and again we will behave like scientists and watch and observe and see what we notice H Now here is a liquid That is bubbling and steaming like the water was H when there were the f when there was a flame underneath it But H there's no flame underneath this liquid here N_that's different H Let's see what happens when I put a balloon over the top H If we do in fact have a liquid that's turning into a gas with enough force to fill up a balloon and lo and behold H VOX we do VOX H It is filling up the balloon here But H This steam here is very cold And we can see that frost H is forming on the sides of this HI flask HI here H VOX Frost H My God VOX Hx H That's curious Let's see what the temperature is of this liquid H
AUD,NA,XXX
MANY,NA,LAUGHTER
PHIL,IL,Did you guys come from a deprived home or something you didn't have balloons H VOX Fighting over balloons I never thought I'd see the day VOX H I'm going to put this probe here into this liquid and we will see what temperature H this balloon is Uh try to stay in your seats I don't want you guys to run up throughout the show Okay now the temperature of this liquid is H three-hundred and twenty-three degrees below zero H Water becomes a solid at thirty-two degrees above zero And it remains a solid H at every tenjure temperature below that So folks do you think H this three-hundred and twenty-three degree liquid is water
MANY,NA,No
PHIL,IL,H No That's right go ahead and shake your heads in disbelief Of course it's not water H No This folks is liquid H nitrogen VOX Ah yes VOX H Where folks can you find lots of nitrogen In He's like oing this I thought he had bad breath X yes X the air you're breathing right now Your lungs are filled with this stuff all of you H The air is probably about seventy percent nitrogen and uh it's oxygen and other gasses as well H okay Our body takes it all in H But we only use the oxygen We breathe out the nitrogen The reason why the nitrogen is not freezing our lungs H as it is doing this flask here H is because H those molecules are moving much faster H The nitrogen is warmer Probably about seventy degrees I would imagine H But VOX this liquid is very cold indeed Three-hundred and twenty-three degrees below zero VOX H Well to get exactly to get an idea about how cold that is let's use these two bouncing rubber balls I would like you people in the audience to H examine the balls To let me know if H they are in fact average normal everyday balls Testify for the audience VOX Don't bite into it jeesh VOX
AUD,NA,
PHIL,IL,H You've really haven't been fed have you Oh I'm really feeling sorry for you Please bounce it back now
AUD,NA,No don't bounce it
PHIL,IL,H
AUD,NA,X Throw it anywhere else X
PHIL,IL,H H
AUD,NA,Throw it in the water X Right under the water X
PHIL,IL,H That was I'm surprised I caught that Normally I'm f_try to goof I'm like Michael Jordan in the White Sox But anyway H but this time I caught it H So let's see what happens when one of these balls goes into the VOX liquid H nitrogen VOX Now the other one stays out here H with me Where it's nice and warm H Well let's think now about what's happening to this ball It's in the VOX very cold VOX liquid nitrogen Right H So What do you think is happening to the ball Is the ball getting hotter H or colder Everybody say it out loud
AUD,NA,Hotter
MANY,NA,Colder
PHIL,IL,H Colder Okay PAR some people don't agree with you In fact most people don't PAR H Yes it's getting colder H So if the ball is getting colder do you think the ball's molecules H are going faster Or slower
MANY,NA,Slower
PHIL,IL,H Slower okay And that you all concur That is excellent H So if these molecules are going slower H do you think and the ball is getting colder do you think the ball is becoming H MRC more of a solid MRC Or more of a liquid What do you think
AUD,NA,Liquid
PHI,NA, H A liquid only one person thinks that cause everybody didn't want to go all that far out on a limb So let's see H if uh sh H if what this guy is thinking is true If it becomes more of a liquid or more of a solid I will take this ball VOX out VOX H of the liquid nitrogen and we will begin the experiments H Okay now Let's see they look alike don't they they still look pretty much the same except we have steam coming off this ball here let's see H if they bounce as before ENV BALL_BOUNCING
PHIL,IL,H Well this one m bounces pretty much the same but this one is different H That is curious VOX Hmm VOX H Well I must continue my study H Let's see how they react under VOX pressure VOX H GRUNT H Okay GRUNT H alright this one pretty much is absorbing my energy it remains intact but let's see what happens to this ball VOX H H VOX H H H
AUD,NA,Did it break
PHI,NA, VOX No VOX H It broke You see these molecules got slower and slower and slower and H closer together H The ball became more of a solid than before it became harder H Well folks that kinda k it gives you a little bit of an idea of what's happening to our balloons but it still doesn't make it absolutely clear H so H And we'll see what happens to this VOX big old balloon When it interacts with liquid nitrogen VOX H Alright Rather than see what happens tha there and guess at what's happening to these balloons in the container we will see what happens H to a balloon when it interacts with liquid nitrogen in the light of day H Alright I'm pouring the very cold liquid nitrogen over this balloon H So the balloon and its contents the air inside is getting colder and colder and colder H Okay those molecules are slowing down They're going slower and slower H and so they're getting closer and closer together Okay H You still have the same number of air molecules inside this balloon H as you did before H It's just that H they're going slower so they're closer together and they take up less space H in this H balloon And look at the balloon H At the very bottom of it You can see a liquid H That's the air people How often do you get to see liquified air but that is the air H The molecules have gotten so slowed down and so close together that H they're less they're not in the as much in the form of a gas now they're more in the form H of a liquid H But now The air around it H is causing those molecules to speed up VOX VOX H Ha ha H And so the molecules are speeding up they're getting further and further apart H and taking up more space inside the balloon so the balloon goes back to its former size and shape H So that has to be what's happening H to the balloons that are inside this container here H Alright SWALLOW Yes these balloons are in the very cold liquid nitrogen H and so those molecules slowed down H and got closer together Hx H the air took up less space inside the balloons So I can fit VOX all VOX those balloons H into this HI little itty-bitty container HI H VOX But now VOX H I'm taking the balloons out of this container H so the molecules are speeding up H The air is VOX heating up VOX okay And so the molecules are going H faster and faster and they're getting further and further apart H they're taking up less space H inside I'm sorry taking up more and more space inside these balloons H And you might want to protect your eardrums Cause sometimes as these balloons expand they pop And let me tell you I get quite shell shocked at the end of the day H So this really teaches us a lot people this tells us that the difference ENV POP
PHIL,IL,VOX Ow VOX H The difference in a substance between a solid a liquid and a gas H like water is how fast the molecules are moving And that different substances become a solid a liquid and a gas at different temperatures and temperature H is a measurement of how fast or slow H molecules are moving H That's what I wanted to tell you people I love to share that with everyone that I meet H if you have any questions about this or any other subject come on up and ask H even if you don't I certainly hope you have a great day here at the Museum of Science VOX and Industry VOX Hx ENV POP

DARRYL,CA,But but to try and and talk me out of believing in Murphy's Law by offering a miracle as a replacement that doesn't d work TSK H
PAMELA,CA,Well you're right I think they're probably flip sides
DARRYL,CA,TSK I mean who are you
PAMELA,CA,But I'm
DARRYL,CA,Pollyanna
PAMELA,CA,SWALLOW TSK Hardly
DARRYL,CA,
PAMELA,CA,Hardly look where I've come from H I mean Hx H this chapter on heaven an hell it's really interesting
DARRYL,CA,Why
PAMELA,CA,I used to have this sort of standard line that there were two things I got out of my marriage One was a name that was easy to spell and one was a H a child Hx That really got me grounded But H the fact of the matter is H that the marriage itself I mean as hellish as it was it's like it pulled me under like a giant octopus or a giant giant shark H And it pulled me all the way under And then H and there I was it was like the silent scream and then then I found that I was on my own two feet again And it really was H Hx Hx H TSK S what was hell in that that marriage became became a way out for me It was the flip side H It's like sometimes you go through things and you come out the other side of them WH you WH come out so much better H And if I hadn't had that if I hadn't had H
DARRYL,CA,It's not the way with food
PAMELA,CA,What do you mean
DARRYL,CA,H What goes in one way
PAMELA,CA,
DARRYL,CA,doesn't come out XXX
PAMELA,CA,H Kay H comes out very hellish
DARRYL,CA,H Yeah
PAMELA,CA,Very hellish
DARRYL,CA,So what X did that have to do X
PAMELA,CA,But it's so good_/god k so good going down Th I mean
DARRYL,CA,What did
PAMELA,CA,there's there's the opposites again
DARRYL,CA,It's it's ma
PAMELA,CA,The food is like all unique
DARRYL,CA,Hey
PAMELA,CA,and wonderful
DARRYL,CA,I it's major-league Yin and Yang
PAMELA,CA,and heavenly TSK major league
DARRYL,CA,What does that have to do with heaven and hell in the book
PAMELA,CA,Well I'm just sort of reiterating I could read you some
DARRYL,CA,No
PAMELA,CA,I mean is that allowed
DARRYL,CA,No I I don't want to hear anything out of a book with chapter called heaven and hell
PAMELA,CA,You don't
DARRYL,CA,No
PAMELA,CA,Nkay Well then let's talk about our vacation
DARRYL,CA,I'm gonna be closed-minded about it
PAMELA,CA,TSK Oh dear Hx
DARRYL,CA,H But
PAMELA,CA,That's hell
DARRYL,CA,I didn't like the book the way I the minute I looked at it
PAMELA,CA,You didn't
DARRYL,CA,No
PAMELA,CA,That's cause you
DARRYL,CA,That's because I have my own ideas about it I guess That I'm pretty comfortable with
PAMELA,CA,ah
DARRYL,CA,I don't like re I don't like reading books about what other people think about dying And I consider myself a real free thinker when it comes to that stuff
PAMELA,CA,TSK H Well
DARRYL,CA,And that's
PAMELA,CA, Remember remember it in the movie in Beetlejuice The handbook for the recently deceased
DARRYL,CA,Yeah
PAMELA,CA,X I mean X books words I mean n they just become handbooks You distill them and use them in your own way
DARRYL,CA,P No P no no I don't I don't H I I come up with my own ideas about that stuff
PAMELA,CA,And where do you get the ideas
DARRYL,CA,Thought
PAMELA,CA,And where do you get those thoughts
DARRYL,CA,Processing what goes on around me
PAMELA,CA,Well Isn't a book part of what goes on around you
DARRYL,CA,H Well more from an oblique source You know X when X you're reading fiction or H or articles or history or something like that H but but t for me it's very difficult to pick up a book about death H That someone's written about death because it's bullshit
PAMELA,CA,H Well
DARRYL,CA,Who knows what death is
PAMELA,CA,What d what what this man has put in the boo You haven't read the book one You haven't read the book so you don't know I haven't read the book so I don't know
DARRYL,CA,Yeah but I do know it it's an awfully it's it's an awfully presumptuous thing
PAMELA,CA,but H
DARRYL,CA,to sit down and write a book about death
PAMELA,CA,d
DARRYL,CA,when you haven't died
PAMELA,CA,It has it has it has stories in there from H from the Zen and f it just pools on other different
DARRYL,CA,Well the Zen can be bullshit too
PAMELA,CA,different sources
DARRYL,CA,I mean whoever wrote the book of Zen wasn't dead either
PAMELA,CA,Well F it might all be bullshit F
DARRYL,CA,Hx
PAMELA,CA,but you g you g you've gotta pull these ideas from your environment and what's gone on before H Th th the things I know most about life and death come from from my grandmother H And having gone through all that With her H And then it was interesting cause reading I did after that substantiated that experience H For two months prior to her death did I tell you this That she dreamt H About um H she had this dream of falling off a building H Down o H Just like that that cartoon we saw
DARRYL,CA,Falling Yeah
PAMELA,CA,The animation cartoon
DARRYL,CA,yeah yeah yeah
PAMELA,CA,H And it was like that And that's what she was dreaming about And then she said that she dreamt about H um all of her relatives that had died She wasn't dreaming about anybody who was living but who had died
DARRYL,CA,H
PAMELA,CA,And I read that later You know it was much later I read that in a book where H um H people who had technically died and then have been revived H Saw relatives coming for them
DARRYL,CA,I've read that
PAMELA,CA,H Course that may be what happens prior to the big the big nothing
DARRYL,CA,H So why are you reading a book about dying
PAMELA,CA,P I don't know P
DARRYL,CA,you don't know
PAMELA,CA,I have an interest in it
DARRYL,CA,Why You're alive Why are you reading a book about dying
PAMELA,CA,I've always been interested in it
DARRYL,CA,W Why W I mean you know you ask someone why they're interested in electronics and they can probably tell you H
PAMELA,CA,H Well I don't know I guess it must fo some reason I was fascinated with that movie last night With H with uh Lilian Gish and B
DARRYL,CA,
PAMELA,CA,and Bette Davis H I couldn't believe H These two old I don't know Hx I wanna say windbags Ha but what happens to them I H here's Betty Davis I mean
DARRYL,CA,VOX Sarah VOX
PAMELA,CA,X z yeah X H This incredible film legend And we think of her in Jezebel we think of her H you know smoking H cigarette smoke into the faces of William Holden and H and the like
DARRYL,CA,I don't I've never seen those movies
PAMELA,CA,TSK You've never seen Betty Davis movie You've heard Kim The song Betty Davis Eyes
DARRYL,CA,Sure
PAMELA,CA,H And she's got she got the woman's got a rep
DARRYL,CA,YAWN
PAMELA,CA,And so she she lives and
DARRYL,CA,YWN Yeah YWN
PAMELA,CA,I guess it's j looking at my mother too I n Hx
DARRYL,CA,What does that have to do with why you're reading a book on death H
PAMELA,CA,H I've always been interested in death
DARRYL,CA,F Why F H
PAMELA,CA,Why
DARRYL,CA,WH WH
PAMELA,CA,H yeah I'm laughing
DARRYL,CA,What is
PAMELA,CA,H I'm thinking one thing my mother always used to say when I wouldn't go bicycling with my father
DARRYL,CA,Pamela you are 
PAMELA,CA,she would say
DARRYL,CA,you are 
PAMELA,CA,she would say H Q you'll be sorry when we're dead Q
DARRYL,CA,Because you wouldn't bicycling
PAMELA,CA,Mm Because I wouldn't go bicycling with my father
DARRYL,CA,Oh So i w it's it's Hx
PAMELA,CA,You know H and I h I bit my tongue the other day because remember you said to Deven well I really want to spend time with you
DARRYL,CA,Yeah
PAMELA,CA,And then we went to the Chalk Fair and then he took off with Tobias
DARRYL,CA,The Chop Fair
PAMELA,CA,The Chalk
DARRYL,CA,Oh
PAMELA,CA,The Chalk Fair
DARRYL,CA,unhunh
PAMELA,CA,H And he took off with Tobias
DARRYL,CA,Yeah
PAMELA,CA,Is that that that I wanted to say with him well your dad wanted to spend time with you today And why did you run off TSK And I didn't because I remembered H that my mother tried to guilt me the same way
DARRYL,CA,YWN So that's why you're interested in death YWN
PAMELA,CA,SIGH
DARRYL,CA,YAWN TSK
PAMELA,CA,TSK TSK X Maybe X it's because my parents were old When I was young Very very young I've always thought it's weird that we've been H I look down at my body And I feel like I'm in a spaceship
DARRYL,CA,Yeah
PAMELA,CA,
DARRYL,CA,WH WH
PAMELA,CA,H I just
DARRYL,CA,That's why you're interested in death
PAMELA,CA,H n and
DARRYL,CA,
PAMELA,CA,I just think it's MRC so damn weird MRC we're here
DARRYL,CA,Yeah Yeah well it is
PAMELA,CA,And and I was constructed inside of some woman's womb H and I was burped out
DARRYL,CA,H So H so you're running you're running down the road all the way to the very end Hunh
PAMELA,CA,H
DARRYL,CA,N you're you're you're already standing at the end of the road
PAMELA,CA,H
DARRYL,CA,trying to figure out what happens there
PAMELA,CA, Well n n Maybe I maybe I'm just eager to get back to where I was H May
DARRYL,CA,Back into the womb
PAMELA,CA,No no no I maybe maybe this whole lifetime was just a really rude interruption
DARRYL,CA,Of what of what
PAMELA,CA,Of whatever it was I was doing before I was H before my number came up H And I was told I had to come back here H
DARRYL,CA,H What if What if
PAMELA,CA,Hx Unhunh
DARRYL,CA,What if worrying about that
PAMELA,CA,See this is what you told Deven
DARRYL,CA,well what if worrying about that has got in the way gotten in the way of you making positive choices for yourself in your life H Instead of just worrying about w that you're here and making the best out of it
PAMELA,CA,Being here is is so illusive sometimes I mean illusionary
DARRYL,CA,Those are two different words and they mean two different things
PAMELA,CA,Well it's illusionary I take back what I said about illusive
DARRYL,CA,
PAMELA,CA,H H H
DARRYL,CA,Y you may be elusive H well
PAMELA,CA,Mm
DARRYL,CA,yeah but but but to me the whole point is is you have no idea what happens before or after You have no idea You can read books about it and you can H talk about it but the most pragmatic thing to do is to just live it
PAMELA,CA,Hm
DARRYL,CA,Learn the rules of the game play the game
PAMELA,CA,For what
DARRYL,CA,for whatever you want For what%ever you want Be a doctor or a screen writer or an actress or a philanthropist or an explorer

DARRYL,CA,H
PAMELA,CA,H
DARRYL,CA,Don't make light of what I'm saying
PAMELA,CA,No Think about the kids What are who are who are these kids W Who are these kids W H These little seedpods H that have been sent our way
DARRYL,CA,H Hx Well sometimes for me they are a whip and a hairshirt
PAMELA,CA,
DARRYL,CA,WH WH
PAMELA,CA,H They're little little little lessons H
DARRYL,CA,TSK Yeah ah yeah I mean sometimes I have to be real prep
PAMELA,CA,GASP
DARRYL,CA,What
PAMELA,CA,XX Natalie asked me about Santa Claus today
DARRYL,CA,What did she what did she say
PAMELA,CA,In the laundromat She said mom Santa Claus isn't I mean d is there a for real Sa Santa Claus I said a for real Santa Claus you mean a man who lives at the north pole H She said yeah I said no H And she said well who are the other ones I said well they're the spirit of Santa Claus and H they represent Santa Claus They H they're a picture of Santa Claus
DARRYL,CA,They're Santa Claus's agents
PAMELA,CA,H They're pictures of Santa Claus Is my mike on
DARRYL,CA,Unhunh
PAMELA,CA,Oh Okay
DARRYL,CA,H It sure is
PAMELA,CA,H And
DARRYL,CA,you just damn near broke the damn needle there
PAMELA,CA,and then she said and then she said well who fills the stockings And I kind of I said love fills the stockings
DARRYL,CA,Oh God Pamela
PAMELA,CA,She said H she said oh you mean adults
DARRYL,CA,H
PAMELA,CA,Adults who wanna show you how much they care and I said H yeah Adults adults around who love you Fill those stockings H And I said she said but some adults talk about Santa Claus I said that's because they wanna believe in Santa Claus H And that's what I told her I said I wanna believe in Santa Claus In fact sometimes I do believe in Santa Claus And that that really satisfied her
DARRYL,CA,H
PAMELA,CA,H <F But I thought it was very pragmatic of her to ask about that in June F>.
DARRYL,CA,Yeah but what d-
PAMELA,CA,H I thought to myself if she asked me that like on Christmas Eve
DARRYL,CA,well she must have gotten some sort of a signal somewhere ENV MICROPHONE
PAMELA,CA,Today in the laundromat
DARRYL,CA,X I mean X what does that have to do with death WH WH
PAMELA,CA,Well we were talking about death and illusions
DARRYL,CA,H
PAMELA,CA,the illusions of this life H you know I H I I
DARRYL,CA,X X X
PAMELA,CA,VOX my favorite word when I was twelve VOX was paradox
DARRYL,CA,YWN Why YWN
PAMELA,CA,H Because I thought any word that was defined I mean I remember the definition H That I learned in seventh grade H That was paradox H Seemingly contrary
DARRYL,CA,TSK Seemingly P X X X P
PAMELA,CA,Seemingly con H and I had a hard time with the definition H So I thought God H A word H That I'm supposed to learn H and I get this definition and I don't even understand the definition
DARRYL,CA,The definition of the word paradox is by design ambiguous Chew on this one An ambiguous paradox
PAMELA,CA,Is that redundant
DARRYL,CA,Yes
PAMELA,CA,GROAN H
DARRYL,CA,GROAN WH WH
PAMELA,CA,Well that was age twelve So that was very close to Deven's age when H I sort of bit my teeth into that one
DARRYL,CA,Bit your teeth hunh
PAMELA,CA,H And then yeah
DARRYL,CA,
PAMELA,CA,As I went @@@@
DARRYL,CA,@@@@@@@@
PAMELA,CA,H I
DARRYL,CA,H
PAMELA,CA,took a bite
DARRYL,CA,Is is that like cutting it in the nip
PAMELA,CA,
DARRYL,CA,
PAMELA,CA,H I I get a little ahead of myself
DARRYL,CA,H Yeah I guess you do H
PAMELA,CA,H Oh God I hope this doesn't all sound real stupid
DARRYL,CA,H X
PAMELA,CA,H Well From from twelve to seventeen then that went from paradox to the invisible interfacing with the visible
DARRYL,CA,TSK Hunh
PAMELA,CA,The invisible interfacing with the visible
DARRYL,CA,Facing X COMMA OR PERIOD
PAMELA,CA,H For everything you see You can look at me and I'm a body H You see eyes you see body you see hair you see
DARRYL,CA,
PAMELA,CA,SLAP S get your hands off me H
DARRYL,CA,H
PAMELA,CA,You HI see HI all those things right
DARRYL,CA,VOX Yeah VOX
PAMELA,CA,But there's there's me inside That's invisible
DARRYL,CA,It's not it's it's n it's it's
PAMELA,CA,H I mean H what if what if you took the same spacesuit And you put another spirit into it It would be a different person
DARRYL,CA,It'd say let me out LAUGHTER
PAMELA,CA,LAUGHTER It would be a different person
DARRYL,CA,X You're X right
PAMELA,CA,I wouldn't be me
DARRYL,CA,Right That's right It'd be a different personality
PAMELA,CA,H So I I I think it's very fascinating
DARRYL,CA,Of course that's a hypothetical how do you know that
PAMELA,CA,H it's very interesti
DARRYL,CA,Maybe may
PAMELA,CA,Hx
DARRYL,CA,maybe
PAMELA,CA,
DARRYL,CA,maybe maybe the spacesuit has something to do with with who's inside of it H I mean you don't know that
PAMELA,CA,TSK H Wouldn't that be f a fascinating experiment
DARRYL,CA,<A Well no because look A Genes Genetic makeup It's proven And that's part of the spacesuit if you wanna use that That that your genetic makeup largely determines who you are
PAMELA,CA,You mean the chemical bath I sit in
DARRYL,CA,Yeah As it were H Hx
PAMELA,CA,Hm Sort of dictates how I feel about being in this spacesuit
DARRYL,CA,Yes Yes right R you know and it depends on your brain dolphin level and
PAMELA,CA,H My brain dolphin XX X X
DARRYL,CA,mm
PAMELA,CA,that's sweet
DARRYL,CA,you know
PAMELA,CA,Hunh
DARRYL,CA,X I depend am X yeah Yeah A lot of it has to do with the with the the r TSK H five dollars and ninety-eight cents worth of chemicals and compounds that make you
PAMELA,CA,We could spend a lot of our life trying to to contradict that
DARRYL,CA,F Why F
PAMELA,CA,H Well Because
DARRYL,CA,
PAMELA,CA,H it may be a very bad chemical bath
DARRYL,CA,H
PAMELA,CA,H We may
DARRYL,CA,SNIFF
PAMELA,CA,b been put into something that's completely acid to our true essence H
DARRYL,CA,Yeah but we have no choice in that matter
PAMELA,CA,And we spend a lifetime that's right N well no H apparent choice No choice that we know of
DARRYL,CA,Mn yeah Hm hm y yeah But but rather than than
PAMELA,CA,H I mean I'm not I'm not I'm not all bent out of shape about it
DARRYL,CA,@@@
PAMELA,CA,H But I've just X but I was thi X>
DARRYL,CA, X You're just really interested in death
PAMELA,CA,My yearning my yearning
DARRYL,CA,
PAMELA,CA,my yearning is n maybe not to run ahead and
DARRYL,CA,H
PAMELA,CA,and and and get to the exit H As
DARRYL,CA,H W
PAMELA,CA,I mean maybe it's the yearning for where I was before I was born
DARRYL,CA,H Well how is write reading a book written by some schmuck who thinks he's an expert on death H
PAMELA,CA,Well he may or may not be a schmuck Darryl
DARRYL,CA,H Anyone who sits down to write a book about death with the hopes of enlightening his fellow human beings H is in my book a schmuck
PAMELA,CA,TSK H Well now VOX them's fightin words
DARRYL,CA,
PAMELA,CA,boy VOX You could H
DARRYL,CA,Who the hell is someone anyone who's living to sit down and write a book about death H
PAMELA,CA,
DARRYL,CA,Now really
PAMELA,CA,H
DARRYL,CA,You know It's like it's these this this is the person who falls under that that H category of expert that I disdain so much I know a lot about
PAMELA,CA,H Maybe he's a MRC very old soul MRC Hx
DARRYL,CA,Hx
PAMELA,CA,Please
DARRYL,CA,Like Old King Cole  COMMA OR PEROID
PAMELA,CA,@@@
DARRYL,CA,LAUGHTER
PAMELA,CA,LAUGHTER Hm TSK H Well Hx
DARRYL,CA,TSK If he's a very old soul he should keep it to himself
PAMELA,CA,H you know Hx I felt l after Gretchen died it was all rather unfair I mean the tides at work just swept over her so quickly H And it was like
DARRYL,CA,But really not so quickly it was X<P yeah P>X I mean it was something that had started in her a very long time ago
PAMELA,CA,She was gone in less than five months Six Eight months
DARRYL,CA,H THROAT

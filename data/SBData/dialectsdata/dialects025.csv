FOSTER,DE,So Erasmus laid the the laid the egg which Luther hatched TSK And um when you come then to Hx uh however this debate This freedom of the will H Um I think uh let me read you a page from Brendler Because it sets the sa stage very nicely This is in the Luther book some of you are reading H and um if you H this evening when you go home if you wanna meditate it on more Hx on on it more it's on page three eleven TSK H It's on page three eleven H But let me just read you the cause this gives us the setting very nicely and then we can uh H READ Erasmus entitled his anti-Luther pamphlet diatribe concerning free will TSK H Once again the first H and fundamental questions disputed in fifteen sixteen and fifteen seventeen and again in Heidelberg in April of fifteen eighteen H with which Luther had opened the assault on scholastic theology were debated Luther was glad to take up the theme of this debate READ TSK And this is what Luther writes to Erasmus H READ You alone Among all the others H have recognized the key question H And you do not bore me H With the Papacy purgatory indulgences and similar nonsense H You and you alone have identified that on which all else hinges H And you have put the razor to the throat H And for that I thank you heartily H Um thus Luther evalu uh evaluated the subject And Erasmus commented on the significance H of their engagement in battle in his own style READ TSK H And he wrote to Luther READ TSK H Perhaps an Erasmus who writes against you H will do more for the Gospel H than certain dunderheads who support you READ H And then READ humanistic thinking will never consent READ this is Brendler now obs uh on this uh but this sets the stage for what we're gonna talk about H READ humanistic thinking will never consent to the doctrine of original sin READ TSK Pico de la Mirandela would not have consented to the doctrine of original sin H TSK The author of uh what is it Houseman I think of Invictus Q I am the master of my fate H I am the captain of my soul Q H I don't think that he would Hx acknowledge original sin H READ Is based READ uh alright what is it it's READ based as it is on the concept that human nature is totally depraved H and of itself not capable of any good will H TSK And that apart from grace alone H free will is nothing can do nothing does nothing H except depraved deeds H Even though these pronouncements are Biblically based and may be acceptable within an exclusively theological system H they do not appear SWALLOW reconcilable with the dignity of man dignity of man H Catholic and semi-pelagianism TSK with all of it's emphasis on on the role of prevenient grace H finally views free will as the decisive factor in attaining salvation H Thereby conceptualizing free will H as similar to a healthy man healthy human understanding H for how can a person H be responsible for his deeds if he possesses no free will READ This is what Erasmus asked H TSK READ How can he decide between good and evil So reasoned Erasmus H Such arguments long known to Luther and many times presented to him impressed him H not in the least TSK God alone is salvation H God alone measures guilt H He alone condemns He alone grants grace Justifies and saves When he will and whom he will H Man can do nothing against the divine prerogative H Man can only accept the divine judgment TSK This is in fact best H And if by H And and it is by the divine prerogative that man will H uh that man is well provided for For God alone is infallible and his being is grace and mercy TSK This concept H that man is divinely elected to salvation or to damnation H is the center of the predestination dogma That later the Geneva reformer Calvin H made the center of his teaching H And that subsequently under other historical preconditions and circumstances H could be linked closely with a prosperous middle class in the Netherlands and in England READ H Um uh skip this paragraph this is the paragraph though Right here The next one TSK H P on page three twelve When you when you read if you wanna read it later H READ Therefore Luther did not accept rational arguments against predestination doctrine H Such arguments on the contrary necessarily appeared to Luther H given his theological orientation H as suspicious From the very start H Because they originated from human nature H Which exalted itself against God H The whore reason H Prefers to submit to the Devil H Adjusts to all situations H And proves everything that is demanded of her Human nature MRC does not possess free will MRC H It is like a horse H Ridden by God or the Devil The rider possesses the will The horse obeys READ H Well that's as clear as you can get it TSK Human nature is like a horse Ridden by God or the Devil The rider possesses free will The horse obeys Alright that th_now the debate is joined you see And as you come as Erasmus comes to this he's going to say H well let's look at the Scriptures TSK Now number one we have to admit first v first off H that there seem to be passages there are passages in the Scriptures are there not H THROAT Many Which seem to teach that man is responsible for his deeds and that he may act and has a free will to respond to the invitation of God H Isn't that clear in the Scriptures H Whosoever will may come Um Jesus turned to his disciples you remember when some deserted him and seemed because they were disappointed in some of his sayings H and they were offended by some of the things he said H and they walked no longer with him it said TSK And then he turned to those who remained and he said Q Will ye also go away Q They had a choice Didn't they Will you go away What do you will H And the will apparently was re resided in in these disciples H And so Erasmus is going to say so obviously in Scripture we have paradox We have clear passages of Scripture H which seem to indicate that man POUND has a free will and that he can exercise POUND that will to follow or not to follow H To respond or not to respond H On the other hand H we have passages of Scripture H which seem to indicate that the will is not free and that the and that man i th is man is predestined by a an omnipotent sovereign will of God H We have to take both these pass So it's not a question of the Scriptural authority We both accept the scriptural authority And Erasmus in his writings and in his pamphlet the Liber Arbetrio in his pamphlet the Liber Arbetrio says to Luther qu because it is addressed to Luther you see H he says to Luther H uh I will not church I will not question or I not I will not quote I will not quote the Church Fathers to you H because I understand you accept no Church Father authority H if it is in disagreement with your opinion H So I will quote the only authority that you recognize The Holy Scriptures TSK And so uh exclusively Erasmus will appeal to the Scriptures as his basis H When God created Adam and Eve in the garden he placed them in the garden and he said you have a choice H Uh you have a choice Do not eat of the fruit of the knowledge of the good of the tree of good and evil for on the day ye eat thereof ye shall surely die Now do not do that and obviously God must have given the first H created pair H a choice Because the whole H system of reward or punishment is based upon the decision which is these individuals made Or H when Cain slew Abel H TSK Um if you do well Shall you not be s sustained But if you do evil H Sin crouches at the door If you do well Apparently from this Cain had the ability even after the mur .e+ven after the murder of Abel H he had the ability H to make a positive choice According to Erasmus That's going to be his position H Well Luther TSK um I'll g I'll I'll tell say some of the things that he he picked first Erasmus picked first H and um he's gonna go all through the Scriptures and he's gonna take passages like this H um TSK return return the prophets said did they not to ancient Israel Return to the God of the covenant return H Hosea pleads with Gomer please come back t_you see H And uh this is the symbol of Israel come back to the Lord H come back to the the husband of the covenant come back to the one who called you and summoned you H it's the Erasmus says the whole premise is H that you have a an ability to return That you can make up your mind H to change the course that you're now taking H And that you can go this way or you can go that way H And uh then there are other arguments which are H uh here's uh here's one on um I'll read an excerpt in this uh in this little book this is the um the actual uh wr writings of the s f freedom of the will H here's he he uses Ecclesiastes God and this is a quote H from the b from the book H READ God made man from the beginning H and left him in the hand of his own counsel TSK He added his commandments H and precepts If thou would keep the commandments and perform acceptable fidelity forever H they shall preserve thee He hath set w he hath set water and fire before thee Stretch forth thy hand H to which thou wilt H Before man is life and death Good and evil That which he shall choose H shall be given him READ Choose H So Erasmus's argument is you have a right to choose You can choose H And therefore if you can choose this presupposes TSK that you have a free will H In any rate if man is uh if there is a necessity in man's action If he is predetermined to sin H If if God has already determined H that this person commits these acts H Then there can be no responsibility on the part of the actor H On the part of the perpetrator Because how can a person be held responsible H for deeds H which he does if he mself did not will those the f if in other words he may will those deeds but those th those deeds were imposed upon his will by a transcendent force H If that is the case then there is really no freedom of the will H And if uh in that case therefore a person cannot be responsible for his deeds H if the deeds which he commits have already been eternally foreordained SNIFF This is uh this is going to be then Erasmus's argument ag on this qu on this question of the freedom of the will H But uh uh H we'll look at another couple p uh of his passages If here it is READ If the will were not free H sin could not be attributed to man TSK It ceases to be sin If it is not voluntary H Free will is not extinct Though it has contracted a paralysis READ SNIFF H How is it paralyzed Well it's paralyzed by the fall See we all participate in the Adamic nature TSK H And this Adamic nature uh when Adam in Adam remember the New Eng New England primer Q in Adam's fall we sinned all Q SNIFF So this Adamic nature has been has been passed on to all generations of humans H And so therefore while we H we have a free will it is it is paralyzed It's not the will that was there H It's not the will that uh that Adam had Because it no longer has the freedom that Adam had It is cursed by sin It is under the curse of sin H So the human will somehow is paralyzed H Uh Erasmus admits that H And then Erasmus will say that um TSK H God then enables What God does and this will be the C really the modern Catholic view H That God will provide a prevenient grace A prevenient grace That is in other words even though I am unwilling to accept the gift of salvation you see H that um that God will give me a prevenient grace H which will enable me to move toward this salvation TSK H And if I then respond positively H To the gift of God H then God will extend the exemplary grace to me which enables me to acquire salvation H So prevenient grace will put you on the path H If you respond on the path H then God extends the exemplary grace H which will lead you home H He uses a little story A little uh uh allegory Or figure I guess H TSK Uh there uh there's a n Hx there's a tot a toddler H TSK Uh but he's got to be big enough to appreciate apples Okay Because his H alright because that's the that's part of the story H There a nice shiny apple Over here TSK H Over here you see And this little tot he sees the apple TSK H And he uh he needs he wants to get to this apple H Um so he starts in the direction of the apple But he's very unsteady He wavers You see and he's not H so what is the prevenient grace The prevenient grace is the adult H which doesn't take him to the apple doesn't lift him up and put him next to the apple H b but goes along with him just guiding him making sure that he he doesn't fall H he just he lets him get there H But he just more or less H supports or sustains the little tot in his motion toward the apple H So the little tot you see TSK Has decided he wants the apple Once he sees it H uh then he he moves toward it H Prevenient grace assists him toward that apple H It doesn't as I said it doesn't carry him there H it doesn't go get the apple and bring it to him H he must go to the apple But he goes sustained by this prevenient grace And then H if he H if he half way to the apple if he decides he doesn't want it if he if he sees something he th considers more attractive and he goes off on a tangent or goes off in a different direction H then you see then his will has decided that he does not want to cooperate With prevenient grace H Luther hated that word cooperation W particularly in connection with grace H Now Luther's position is we are dead in trespasses and sin H You see There is H nothing H that can come to us you see now Luther came to his reformation remember H with this fear of the righteousness of God H The righteousness of God And Luther all through his monastic life up until around fifteen fifteen is probably when he made that tower discovery H That so-called L Turmerlebnis L H The tower experience TSK Where reading in Romans one seventeen he read H you know THROAT the j the just shall live by faith well you have to take rea really read Romans one sixteen first H TSK Um READ I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ H For it is the power of God onto salvation To everyone that believeth H to the Jew first and also to the Greek H For therein READ therein it can only refer grammatically to Gospel you see H READ I am not ashamed of the Gospel H For therein H Is the righteousness of God revealed As it is written MRC The just shall live by faith MRC>READ And when he discovered this he had read this a hundred times But this one time when he read it H he said suddenly it dawned on him What this meant Q And this place in Paul Q Luther said Q Became for me H the gate of paradise Q L Es ging mir ein Licht auf L H The light broke in on me H And what was this light TSK That the righteousness of God is passive righteousness It's not the righteousness you see Luther said Q I hated that that phrase righteousness of God H What does righteousness of God mean H Righteousness of God means H God is holy H And I'm a sinner And I can never stand in his presence H And the gulf between us can never be bridged and he's gonna cast me into Hell because of my sin H What shall I do to earn the righteousness of God Q So you see he was constantly H preoccupied with this thought H of somehow H satisfying the righteousness of God H Through some work H Through some indulgence H Through some prayer S_through through through renunciation Through fasting Through vigils H You know he says if a monk if a m m H Q if ever a monk could've gained heaven through his monkery H it would have been I H H You see

RANDY,NA,H You know it's it was really pretty straightforward this morningLANCE,WA,HRANDY,NA,H And y z I thought you did a good job all the way through I mean you were on top of what you were scanningLANCE,WA,Hm Thanks SNIFFRANDY,NA,umLANCE,WA,should've kept that one Horizon Fauker jet just t keep em on the rightRANDY,NA,Why did you switch emLANCE,WA,H Well Hx looking at something I would get it didn't seem like I could get someone else out But H um and part of it to provide a good service but thenRANDY,NA,Yeah H Well that that I guess that's one reason the two eight's kind of well two eight's kinda nice sometimes because I mean when we're on ten all the departures seemed like they're going out the leftLANCE,WA,SNIFFRANDY,NA,H so you really want your arrivals on the right When you're landing two eight H then you can get departures off of almost both at any timeLANCE,WA,SNIFFRANDY,NA,So you always got a holeLANCE,WA,N_yeah YeahRANDY,NA,So but uh don't feel bad about keeping Horizon on the right X boy X becauseLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,H sure doesn't hurt them to taxi X any X They're so used to having A number one serviceLANCE,WA,"TSK H Yeah plus when they're departing,g"RANDY,NA,every one of em cameLANCE,WA,they're right by the gate H Everyone even even one or one or two of em I said I'll advise if the left becomes available H and they said wRANDY,NA,and they they still askLANCE,WA,we'd like the left if it becomes available RANDY,NA, H@ I know they still askLANCE,WA,SNIFFRANDY,NA,And Viking is the same way HLANCE,WA,YeahRANDY,NA,So There's sh there's sure nothing wrong with keeping em on the right though Um Traffic Watch Eight we discussedLANCE,WA,H TSK So radar service terminatedRANDY,NA,um call me inbound orRANDY,NA,H You wanna say Q radar service terminated frequency change approved Report back inbound Q Or H I I think that something a little ttle more like that's better than just saying radar service terminated because he's kindaLANCE,WA,SNIFFRANDY,NA,Left hangingLANCE,WA,OkayRANDY,NA,And you could just say radar service terminated report back inbound and then he'll he'll either come back and say well I'm departing the area now back to Hillsborrow H Or I'll call you back inbound So that gives you an ideaLANCE,WA,OkayRANDY,NA,But uh and uh H Along with that Let TC do more of the work for youLANCE,WA,OkayRANDY,NA,you know Um just tell her what you want her to doLANCE,WA,SNIFFRANDY,NA,H I was thinking of a couple instances where you could've used her more than you didLANCE,WA,Okay H I was thinking that for my rundowns you know that would that's that would have been a help but H on the other s the other handBILL,NA,I wanna get it on tape heck of a job LanceRANDY,NA,H H HLANCE,WA,Oh thank you very much Did you hear that H um HRANDY,NA,H The problem with doing rundowns is that it's kind of over in your faceLANCE,WA,Yeah Yeah SoRANDY,NA,Cause the D-light's kind of pretty far over to the left there but sh you can you can have her do it if you wantLANCE,WA,TSK H Um H I would I'm just working at doing as much of these other things as I possibly can Because they'll be times when I won't have a TC and just just challenging myselfRANDY,NA,And that's okay HLANCE,WA,H Um what were some of the things other than what what were some of the things that H that I should have used her for that I didn'tRANDY,NA,H Depending on who yourLANCE,WA,SNIFFRANDY,NA,Who your TC is if c certain people sit down there they d they have a tendency to do everything for you H And sometimes that is p that is really pretty nice H If you just if you just all you have to do is stand up and look out the window and look at the bright and talk You no other w no other coordination or or ARTS functions or anything H That really is niceLANCE,WA,TSK That's idealRANDY,NA,It it really helpsLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,the situationLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,So but Right now like you say maybe it is better for you to do some of that stuffLANCE,WA,SNIFF TSK um I don't think there was Hx I mean I had just a couple that I switched to the left you know maybe three or so that I switched to the left uh p uh probably two or three H and so there was that I didn't have any ARTS entries I had you know Traffic Watch to slue out toRANDY,NA,YAWNLANCE,WA,umRANDY,NA,YAWN YWN Yeah YWNLANCE,WA,For the most part I mean I was able to k I think I was able to keep up with that stuffRANDY,NA,With the ARTSLANCE,WA,Yeah I mean there wasn't really nothing much to do H umRANDY,NA,No there wasn'tLANCE,WA,SoRANDY,NA,But there could beLANCE,WA,YeahRANDY,NA,If there's VFRs departing orLANCE,WA,Yeah I told her to do my VFR guysRANDY,NA,h YeahLANCE,WA,And um to write down my VFRs H That's one thing I gotta kick myself to doRANDY,NA,YeahLANCE,WA,Now are we still required to w write like the Empires that coming in through the gates VFR Don't they We areRANDY,NA,Any VFRLANCE,WA,h H Now isn't that aren't they when they c But what if they've c well I guess we have no way of knowing if they've come in IFR and then cancelled VFRRANDY,NA,Well yeah because they have a strip on it downstairsLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,So I don't actually I'm like you I don't really know what the point is of that Because we do have a record of em anyway ButLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,when the when the order came across or whatever X or this X memorandum that said to write down all VFR arrivalsLANCE,WA,TSK OkayRANDY,NA,So if they're a VFR arrival you're supposed to write it downLANCE,WA,Okay P I'll do that then PRANDY,NA,Unhunh H When Horizon one-thirty-eight didn't answer you thereLANCE,WA,H Go back to groundRANDY,NA,YeahLANCE,WA,or just move on to something elseRANDY,NA,I mean you tried him a couple times You say Horizon one-thirty-eight XXXXX if they don't get the hint if he's H but if you can't get him just go on and do something else that you can do United was calling ready to goLANCE,WA,YeahRANDY,NA,So shoot just let United go HorizonLANCE,WA,YeahRANDY,NA,you can't do nothing with him so just have him hold there So just go on to the nextLANCE,WA,TSK OkayRANDY,NA,Next thing and do tell ground He might be still on ground frequency which isLANCE,WA,SNIFFRANDY,NA,H uh usually not too likely because you knowLANCE,WA,At that pointRANDY,NA,At that point well he's out thereLANCE,WA,you know He'sRANDY,NA,and he's probably sitting thereLANCE,WA,SNIFFRANDY,NA,and th he's not hearing anything Hx from the tower you knowLANCE,WA,YeahRANDY,NA,he's probably looking at his radio about then H HxLANCE,WA,H Yeah I think I was a little bit rigid in my planning of that cause I wanted to had to plan to get him out at that point and I should've been more flexible andRANDY,NA,But uh you know HX everything else I saw H you your separation was was really good this morning I mean you really tightened em up Maybe a couple times almost a little bit too tightLANCE,WA,a little to tight SNORT HRANDY,NA,Cause uh H I don't know y a couple times you had like one just barely at departure end a jet at departure and you cleared another jet for takeoff H And it worked out greatLANCE,WA,TSK Oh One guy out the right and then oh th both guys out the leftRANDY,NA,Both guys out to the leftLANCE,WA,SNIFFRANDY,NA,H And it worked out good but I think it worked out because TSK this guy was real slow on on starting his departure roll H You knowLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,usually you gotta get em just a little bit off the departure end before you clear the next guy H And watch out for the uh the seven-thirty-seven four-hundredsLANCE,WA,Four-hundreds OkayRANDY,NA,Or three-hundreds and HLANCE,WA,OkayRANDY,NA,Because uh they'll really climb And they can go fast tooLANCE,WA,OkayRANDY,NA,So well you know just take into consideration the type of aircrafts It takes the seven-twenty-seven a little b while to get wound up while the seven-thirty-seven'll really go But uh I mean it was really good Good departure separationLANCE,WA,ThanksRANDY,NA,I was impressed And you saw a little bit about the two-sixty Heading Listen to the readbacks forLANCE,WA,H YeahRANDY,NA,H If I know he's at two-thirty But you can wrap em around to one-thirty or one-sixty to avoid the MBA and that works great because otherwise you got two-sixty H There was that one time you had two south plan aircraft and one westbound or X river X metro andLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,HLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,I d I actually didn't think you were gonna have three miles between the two firstLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,south X plan air lane X but you did That was perfectLANCE,WA,The one that I kept on runway heading for a bitRANDY,NA,YeahLANCE,WA,orRANDY,NA,YeahLANCE,WA,OkayRANDY,NA,And that was good it was real good planning to keep that one Caravan on runway heading when you had the other one going two-sixty To ensure that you had oh and you had the one going two-fortyLANCE,WA,HRANDY,NA,or somethingLANCE,WA,HxRANDY,NA,and then you had the Metro going s going two-sixtyLANCE,WA,YeahRANDY,NA,But you kept the Metro on X this X runway heading Which is really good planning SoLANCE,WA,TSK H I'm I'm less and less impacted For lack of a better word by these g for some reason with all these um I think the bulk of my planning seems to revolve around these little guys when I can turn em fitting em in with all my other guys for some reason I mean y H and that is you know those guys having a very fec affective part in the whole fan of all our departures And umRANDY,NA,HmLANCE,WA,I think they're they're a affecting me less than they did in the pastRANDY,NA,YeahLANCE,WA,Does that make senseRANDY,NA,YeahLANCE,WA,H Do you know what I mean H Um cause i there was a time where I mean that sequence was good too H but there was a time when yeah an  it it may happen againRANDY,NA,YeahLANCE,WA,X Who knows X where I've got the little West Coasts in here and all these guys off the right and left where am I actually gonna fit these guys in and they're all calling they're ready way early AndRANDY,NA,Well the sequence H uh can't be too bad When you got when you can feed from charleyLANCE,WA,H XXRANDY,NA,H and from bravo and from alpha You know the sequence can't be too bad I mean all he didLANCE,WA,You got something you can doRANDY,NA,Yeah All he did is send em all out I mean you got all the West Coasts in the row over on charleyLANCE,WA,RANDY,NA,you got the jets in a row on bravo and you got n various things over here H So you can pick and choose You know y I mean as a ground control you can just send em all out there and then H when they get there then you can start arranging the stripsLANCE,WA,RANDY,NA,You know the way you want almostLANCE,WA,YeahRANDY,NA,H You know th that'sLANCE,WA,YeahRANDY,NA,that it works great That wayLANCE,WA,Because you don't have to sequence em at some other point in their taxi route you knowRANDY,NA,YeahLANCE,WA,They're b they .e+ essentially on their own taxiway up through up to the approach end SoRANDY,NA,YAWN YWN So that was about all YWN that I you know that I had I mean I was paying pretty close attention there and I didn't really see much of a problemLANCE,WA,Oh ThanksRANDY,NA,No significant problems XX to talk aboutLANCE,WA,I'm gladRANDY,NA,See there was S H Oh um don't always um don't insist on always saying seven hundred If you sayLANCE,WA,H OhRANDY,NA,Why hadn't youLANCE,WA,at some point after he is leaving seven just wait till he is leaving seven hundred you meanRANDY,NA,Sometimes you can do thatLANCE,WA,YeahRANDY,NA,Yeah There was a couple times you didn't need to say it when when you didLANCE,WA,It was out in the yeahRANDY,NA,Yeah Well I mean y wLANCE,WA,Could've either waited just a bitRANDY,NA,it was at He was at a five-hundred climb andLANCE,WA,Or he was a-RANDY,NA,just go ahead and say turn left heading one six zero OkayRANDY,NA,Or turn left heading two six zero For a Metro I mean if you leave em on runway heading H for a little bitLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,they're gonna be at the altitude you need so but that's no big deal And uh I was watching Jet Speed come in and you got Delta out in front of Jet SpeedLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,It seemed like you were a little tense with that but H really pay attention to the speeds when they're coming in He was doing a hundred and twenty outside of Laker there Did you see thatLANCE,WA,YeahRANDY,NA,YeahLANCE,WA,So that that worked out greatRANDY,NA,I wondered if you'd saw Yeah I mean there was lots of room Lots of timeLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,He wasn't he z wasn't flying as a normalLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,For some reason he just used theLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,Or is it uh Exec Jet One of those guys is usually really fastLANCE,WA,H Jet Speed is th I know fast on the pr departureRANDY,NA,AM-FlightLANCE,WA,it seemsRANDY,NA,YeahLANCE,WA,I think It seems like that was the one but yeah AM-Flight when they fly the later jet H Um yeah And I think I might have said for delta niners or to no delay or something like that andRANDY,NA,Yeah I think you didLANCE,WA,And he was actually floating at the Jet Speed wasn't yeahRANDY,NA,Yeah you had a lot of timeLANCE,WA,YeahRANDY,NA,When the Twins get airborne you got a jet X following X the twin twin's gonna go southwestbound H If you got six-thousand feet and the twin's climbing out of four or five hundred you can start your transmission then to the to the jetLANCE,WA,OkayRANDY,NA,Q Twin Cesna ahead is will be turning southwestbound momentarily runway two eight left clear for takeoff Q It says in sight HLANCE,WA,Just X didn't wanna be X sure he gets his turn inRANDY,NA,Mhm HLANCE,WA,OkayRANDY,NA,The Caravan's coming across if you wanna get HxLANCE,WA,H Yeah what do you say Cause I've heard different phraseology and I af feel like I was stumbling over that I think I said it couple different waysRANDY,NA,A mile west or something I'll I just say H you know on a day like this it's so easy to see em I would just say the Caravan ahead is southwestbound Q Runway two eight left clear for takeoff Q And and they'll a lot of times they'll say uh in sight If they don't say in sight they'll say they'll Hx I would assume they have em in sight because they won't goLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,Unless they seem em I mean that's important to them to see the traffic but it's safe it's a safe operation H Because ne thing Hx you could do is is turn the Caravan to two-forty HLANCE,WA,MhmRANDY,NA,To get him across And then just before you ship em send em back to two-fifty XX something like thatLANCE,WA,HmRANDY,NA,SNIFF Cause the track's what im what's important But but two-fifty was working out fine today Fifteen degrees and a mile Is what you need so or less using visualLANCE,WA,Yeah In fact it was a Was the West Coast that was it the Horizon who said he could do the visual with the Twin Cesna ahead or was it vice versa one of the two ENV PHONE_RINGRANDY,NA,YeahLANCE,WA,And at that point I said don't need it now They got itRANDY,NA,Somebody in thereLANCE,WA,I think Laura went in there yeahBILL,NA,Comm line for you XXX have a call on the other line

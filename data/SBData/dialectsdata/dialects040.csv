DEBRA,KY,H Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen H We'd like to welcome you to the Kentucky Horse Park and to the Hall of Champions presentation H We have four geldings and one stallion that we'll present for you this afternoon H and as we bring them out we'll give you the history on each one and please feel free to take all the pictures that you want and to ask questions Our first horse here today at the Hall of Champions is our only thoroughbred stallion This is Bold Forbes H Bold Forbes is a dark bay or brown stallion and he was foaled in nineteen seventy-three H He is by the stallion Irish Castle and out of the unraced mare Comely Nell H He was bred by Lee Eaton and Red Bull Stables H This grandson of Bold Ruler was entered into a sale in July of nineteen seventy-four H Mister Estaban Tizol a banker and real estate developer from Puerto Rico H liked Bold Forbes pedigree And he liked this horse so much H that he decided he was going to buy him no matter what the cost H The cost ended up being fifteen-thousand two-hundred dollars H and Bold Forbes was then shipped to El Commandante racetrack in San Juan Puerto Rico H In Bold Forbes very first start in Puerto Rico as a two-year-old H he went off at odds of thirty-five to one and he won that race by seventeen lengths H He was entered into four more races he won them all H and in doing so he was named champion two-year-old in Puerto Rico H Well El Commandante is the only racetrack in Puerto Rico H so it didn't take Bold Forbes too long to run out of competition H So in the summer of nineteen seventy-five he was shipped to New York to his new trainer Laz Barrera H In New York he won the Freemont Stakes and the Saratoga Special before he injured his shins and was given the rest of the year off H Well all of Bold Forbes's races up to this point had been sprints or six furlong races H The Kentucky Derby is a much longer race at a mile and a quarter So as a three-year-old Forbes wasn't given much of a chance at all in the Kentucky Derby H But his trainer had more confidence in him than that H and with Angel Cordero junior in the saddle H Bold Forbes won the Kentucky Derby at odds of seventeen to one one length in front of the leader Honest Pleasure H The Preakness however was a disappointment for Bold Forbes He cut his left hind heel during the race but he still managed to run third H But when the Belmont rolled around he had that all healed up and he won the Belmont stakes by a neck H In October Forbes was entered into the Vosburgh Handicap and again he severely bruised his right hind foot H Again he ran a very game third but after this race he was considered too valuable a breeding stallion to risk any more injury H So he was retired to stud from the track H Bold Forbes was syndicated to stud for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars per share H and he stood his entire career at Arthur Hancock Stone Farm H As a stallion Bold Forbes produced a champion filly Tiffany Lass a winner of over half a million dollars H Bold Apparel a champion filly in Italy H Air Forbes One and over two-hundred other winners H Bold Forbes is a winner of over half a million dollars in just two years on the racetrack H He was in eighteen races and had thirteen wins and was never worse than third H He was retired from stud duty in the spring of nineteen ninety-one H He is twenty-one years old and stands fifteen point three hands tall H Ladies and gentlemen the nineteen seventy-six Kentucky Derby winner Bold Forbes

DEBRA,KY,Does anyone have any questions while we're waiting for the next horse to come out Questions Okay while we're waiting I'll just call everyone's attention to this horse I don't know if everyone can see him H over here in this paddock on the right H this is Sergeant Pepper Feature and he's usually in our show but because Bold Forbes is up here today he We kicked him out We have six horses that belong to the Hall of Champions H and only five stalls So we could only have five at a time in the show H Um Sergeant Pepper was the nineteen eighty-two world champion racing quarter horse H and at the time of his retirement he was the eighth richest quarter horse in history H and he had earnings of over nine-hundred thousand dollars So on your way out today you might wanna just take a look over there and say hi to Sergeant Pepper And there's Bold Forbes looking out the window If anybody can see him he's right there H watching the show H Our next horse is the first horse to retire here to the Hall of Champions that is not a racehorse This is Imperator And he is a five-gaited American Saddlebred showhorse H Perry as he is commonly called is by the sire Supreme Sultan who is buried in front of the saddlehorse museum here at the Horse Park H He is out of the dam Empress Wing and she is by the great sire Wing Commander H Only Wing Commander holds more world grand championships than Imperator H Perry was born in Wilmette Illinois H and he was purchased there as a two-year-old by his owner Doctor Geraldine Meanor H and then sent to his trainer Don Harris of Simpsonville Kentucky H Now Perry and Mister Harris had a very special bond that they shared H They both had the same birthday H And as the years went past and Imperator's popularity increased H Mister Harris didn't get too upset when Perry received more birthday cards and presents than he did H Being five-gaited means that Perry performs the three natural gaits the walk trot and canter H plus two manmade gaits the slow gait and the rack H The only difference in these gaits are the speed at which they're performed Perry's greatest accomplishment was winning the five-gaited world grand championship four times H And he has also been reserve world champion five times H He was shown eighty-five times at forty-four shows around the country H He has sixty-eight blue ribbons thirteen seconds and very rarely was he ever worse than third H Now the first time Perry was shown he was very wild and inexperienced and he stepped on just about every foot in the show ring H And he even chased the judges out of the ring on several occasions H But the second time he was shown he had improved so much H the judges said he would have won if he'd been lying on his back with all four feet stuck up in the air H Perry's most beautiful characteristic during his show career was his tail H At the highlight of his career H Perry's tail was fourteen feet long and could be wrapped completely around his body If you wanted to take a picture of all of Perry H you had to take two pictures to include all of his tail H When Perry was retired Mister Harris cut his tail to make it easier to care for H and he was able to make three false tails from the hair he had taken from Perry's tail H Well Perry had been retired here for about two years H but had never had a formal retirement H So in August of nineteen ninety-one Perry was formally retired at the world championship horse show in Louisville Kentucky H That night Imperator and his trainer Mister Don Harris H stepped into the ring one last time together H and were both named the American Saddlebred horse and trainer for the decade of the nineteen-eighties H Perry is now twenty years old and stands fifteen point three hands tall H Ladies and gentlemen the four-time world grand champion Imperator

AUD,NA,What's the average age that a horse lives to
DEBRA,KY,H A good average is about twenty-eight if they're well taken care of Um a lotta horses will live into their thirties H A a good way to compare horse ages to humans is to multiply by three And Except I think the oldest liv Oh oldest horse on record I think in the Guinness Book of World Records was sixty-two So don't multiply that that one by three That would be what H a hundred and eighty-six X or something X H Are there any other questions No If anyone's interested in seeing what Perry looked like when he had his fourteen-foot tail H um when you come into the visitor center I don't know if if anybody noticed this H there's a TV monitor right after you Where you buy your tickets when you come in and you look up and there's a H An ongoing Hall of Champions presentation on this TV monitor up there H and uh there's a little clip of Imperator on there and I think he's slowgaiting which was his most beautiful gait H um and you can see his fourteen-foot tail up there and that was It was really beautiful SNIFF Do you have a question Back there

DEBRA,KY,Okay These horses are are not ridden anymore um they're just l like you said they're retired H they each have their own paddock except for Sergeant Pepper and Imperator they We turn them out together because they're friends H and mostly they just hang out in their paddock and they graze and H they exercise themselves they run around a lot and keep themselves in shape and H that's about all they do They get H they get lots of treats and lots of love and s we think they're happy But H they still run around um just like young horses sometimes John will get out there and run around he'll rear up on his hind legs like Silver you know and do H And uh it's real cute uh Forego'll run around H Willie and his little goat will get out there and H and run and Imperator usually likes to trot He doesn't gallop a lot but he trots around like he did when he was showing and H it's They're real cute There any other questions
AUD,NA,Yes What Uh the goat in with the horse Are they just good friends
DEBRA,KY,Uhuh That's his little buddy They're just friends H He Willie doesn't really like other horses very well H And and he likes people but he's not as affectionate as maybe Perry or Sergeant Pepper so H we don't want him to get lonely and that's his that's his little friend Originally they had got the goat for John Henry when he first came to live here eight years ago H and they put the goat in the stall with him he kicked it back out H and um H so Willie adopted it And that original goat died about a year ago and Willie was real sad and depressed so they got him a new one H Our last horse to come out today is our standardbred representative Rambling Willie H A standardbred races at a trot or a pace and they pull a sulky with a driver H Willie is a pacer H Willie was born in Monroeville Indiana and he began his racing career as a to-year-old for his owner Raymond Gibson H He had four starts with two seconds and two thirds H so he did show some promise but Mister Gibson decided to sell Willie as a three-year-old H Willie was sold to a hall of fame trainer and driver Mister Robert Farrington for fifteen thousand dollars H But not long after he bought him Mister Farrington decided he'd spent too much money on this horse H so he called a friend of his from Cincinnati Ohio Mister Paul Sebert H and he tried to talk Mister Sebert into buying a half interest in Willie H Well Mister Sebert had owned horses before H and his luck had been pretty bad H The first horse he owned died before it made it to the racetrack H and the second horse he owned made it to the races and she ran and ran but just couldn't win anything so he sold her H And after he sold her she went on to win her next four starts in a row for her new owner H Well Mister Sebert did buy a half interest in Willie though H and things didn't start off so well there either Willie was being raced at county fairs in Ohio and Indiana H and was being beaten on a regular basis H Well around this time Mister Farrington's wife Vivian was having a birthday H and he was trying to decide what to get her H So Mister Farrington decided that a good present for Vivian would be the other half of Willie H Well Vivian was a very religious person H and her father at that time was the minister of a nearby church H So Vivian decided that if Willie ever had any success at the racetrack H she would donate ten percent of her half of Willie's earnings to her father's church H And that's when Willie's racing career took off
MANY,NA,LAUGHTER
DEBRA,KY,H Because of his success and his ties to the church there was a book written about Willie titled H Rambling Willie The Horse That God Loved H In order to promote his book Willie would hold autograph sessions H One day when Willie was in New York he had an autograph session at Macy's department store H And he was such a hit there that Macy's gave him his very own charge card
MANY,NA,LAUGHTER
DEBRA,KY,H Well Willie is without a doubt one of the toughest and most durable horses to ever race H He raced from the age of two to thirteen He had an incredible three-hundred and five starts H He won a hundred and twenty-eight times H sixty-nine times he finished second and seventy-nine times he paced the mile in two minutes or less H which is a record Willie still holds today When he retired he was the richest standardbred in history H with earnings over two million dollars H Willie is our other senior citizen here at the Hall of Champions H he is twenty-four years old and stands fifteen point two hands tall H Ladies and gentlemen the horse that God loved Rambling Willie

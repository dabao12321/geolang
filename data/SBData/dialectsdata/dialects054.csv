CYNTHIA,IL,The next story that I have is from the Native Americans H It's called how the stars got in the sky Did you ever wonder how the stars got in the sky This is the way the Indians think that the stars got in the sky H And I learned this story from a white man who had been adopted into a tribe in Michigan In Wisconsin he has taken on all of the Native American ways And the people thought so much of him that they have given him uh also a Native American name And he gave me permission to tell the story H Long ago in the sky there was only the sun and the moon H And on the nights when the moon didn't shine it was very dark Indeed H Well all of the animals got together H and decided they were going to go to the creator To see if he could help with the problem Well when they arrived the creator said I will help you but first you must do something H All of you are to go down to the lake And gather stones H Now not round stones like the moon but jagged stones H And when you have got as many as you can carry H bring them to me and then MRC I will help you MRC And so all the animals went to the lake All except coyote Because L coyote was lazy L
AUD,NA,COUGH COUGH COUGH
CYNTHIA,IL,And he was asleep H So all the animals gathered as many stones as they could carry the large animals had a great many stones H And the little animals like grasshopper and bumblebee they could only carry one
AUD,NA,COUGH COUGH
CYNTHIA,IL,H But they all brought them to the feet of the creator L All except coyote Because he was lazy and
AUD,NA,COUGH COUGH
CYNTHIA,IL,he was asleep L H So the creator looked over all the stones that were brought H and chose one Not too large
AUD,NA,THROAT
CYNTHIA,IL,H and reached up H and placed it in the sky And when he did it began to twinkle And he said H this I will call a star And this one a special star A homing star H The North Star H And this evening all of you animals are going to go off the edge of the Earth into the sky to make your pictures With stars And so that evening all of the animals gathered their stones and they MRC walked off the edge of the world MRC Into the sky To make their pictures H With the brilliant dots that would turn into stars They all went except coyote TSK Because he was lazy And he was asleep H Well after all the animals had gone H the creator called to coyote
AUD,NA,COUGH COUGH
CYNTHIA,IL,He said VOX Coyote come on now get up X Time X Enough of this being lazy come on over here I have a job for you VOX And coyote H VOX<YWN he yawned and YWN>VOX Hx H he got up and he VOX dragged himself to the presence of the creator VOX and said VOX ye yes what what do you need me to do VOX And the creator said well all of the animals have gone off the edge of the Earth to make pictures in the sky H But some of them can't carry very many stones I want you to take this
AUD,NA,COUGH
CYNTHIA,IL,H VOX this great big bag of stones into the sky VOX and when any of the other animals need them then you give them the extras that they need
AUD,NA,COUGH
CYNTHIA,IL,L Well coyote was lazy L And he took one look at that bag and thought VOX hoh I don't wanna do that VOX But you don't argue with the creator
AUD,NA,
CYNTHIA,IL,And so he said he would And he H got up and he took that heavy bag and H put it on his back and he walked off the edge of the Earth
AUD,NA,THROAT
CYNTHIA,IL,Into the sky H Well he hadn't gone very far
AUD,NA,THROAT
CYNTHIA,IL,when that bag started to feel very heavy H And so he looked one way
AUD,NA,THROAT
CYNTHIA,IL,and then he looked the other and he put that big bag down VOX and then he VOX dug both paws in H and threw a whole bunch of stones behind him one way H and a whole bunch the other way
AUD,NA,
CYNTHIA,IL,and of course as soon as they hit the sky they all began to twinkle behind him
AUD,NA,THROAT
CYNTHIA,IL,H and then he picked that bag up put it on his back again Well it wasn't so heavy now So he walked a little further and a little further but that L bag began to feel heavy again L

AUD,NA,COUGH
CYNTHIA,IL,walked a little further Well it felt good for about a minute or two and then lazy coyote he just couldn't stand it anymore L He looked one way he looked the other L then he put that bag down opened it real wide and like a puppy digging a hole he just dug all of those stones H right out of that bag until he got right down to the bottom And all those stones H started sparkling behind him Then he took that bag made sure it was empty folded it up made a little pillow pulled up a comfortable cloud laid down and went to sleep Well pretty soon the animals were running out of stones they started calling VOX coyote we need some more stones over here right over where are you coyote VOX Well
AUD,NA,
CYNTHIA,IL,coyote didn't hear them Because he was lazy and he was asleep WH Well WH the first rays of morning started peeking over the edge of the Earth H and all the animals had to scurry back onto the Earth Before day broke Some of them had to leave their pictures half done Some had only had one stone They could just put up in the sky H A few were finished like the swan and finally when a ray of light hit coyote in the eye he woke up and he realized he too had to hurry back onto Earth So he did But that night MRC when he looked up at the sky MRC that's when he learned how to howl Because he saw L all the other animals with their pictures in the sky L and MRC his wasn't there MRC Because he'd been lazy And he had been asleep And that's the story of how all the stars got in the sky

LAJUAN,IN,VOX H VOX so I get out of my car stop in the driveway SM take em off of each other SM I was like H I'll just kill them
CAM,WI,Those naughty boys
LAJUAN,IN,H But um mm no he just H He he he's become more attached and uh I think a lot of it is because a lot of his friends have now gotten married and have children H and he doesn't do as much with them And I think that's why but he has gotten so attached to me and it
CAM,WI,THROAT
LAJUAN,IN,H I've always been very independent H and a lot of it had to do with like me growing up the way I did with my my um my mother dying
CAM,WI,Mhm
LAJUAN,IN,younger and then living with my one aunt and then my I aunt died when I was twelve H and then moving to another aunt which was moving up here H and I I've always had to go back and forth I've always traveled on my own I've always flown everywhere by myself H uh I've always done everything I've had to deal with my father I I'd listen to my sister when my nephew H started college how she was saying H she filled out all of his applications for where he was going and H she did all of these things when he had to apply for a scholarship or whatever H she filled out everything and I'm like H Hx I did it by myself H you read the form and you fill it out
CAM,WI,Wow
LAJUAN,IN,No one did it for me H you know and I was very much whatever I needed H I I got my money from my father he paid for school H but I did everything on my own I I didn't have anyone
CAM,WI,TSK See my parents weren't very I don't know
LAJUAN,IN,THROAT
CAM,WI,They're not extremely educated and they're not really on top of things H and so when it came to things like that
LAJUAN,IN,THROAT
CAM,WI,they wouldn't know how to help me H
LAJUAN,IN,Really
CAM,WI,Yeah they wouldn't I mean they had no clue they didn't give me any suggestions of where to go to school they said H oh yeah go to school we'll pay for it H We want you to go to school But they had no idea of you know what's a good school what's a bad school you know any type of direction
LAJUAN,IN,H Se Yeah
CAM,WI,They didn't give me anything like that
LAJUAN,IN,and see I feel that's one of the biggest setbacks
CAM,WI,THROAT
LAJUAN,IN,I I see this with H with black youths today is that H because your generations in the past were not educated
CAM,WI,Mm
LAJUAN,IN,H you have a harder time deciding on what's a good school H what's a good curriculum for you to take H your your parents aren't able to talk to you about it H W just as you were saying even though you're not black but you were just saying that H but black children have that even more so
CAM,WI,Right
LAJUAN,IN,Because you har You're you're more likely not to be ha come from educated parents H Whereas I came from an educated family it was just the fact H they made us do everything on our own H And
CAM,WI,Mm
LAJUAN,IN,but black people also th those that have more tried to teach you to be stronger H But I think they instilled s tried m tried to make me so strong H that they forgot that I was a person And I mean like I I often feel like at times that H TSK and maybe it's the gayness coming out in me but H I don't like it like and when I was home just went home to Indiana H I went to hug my sister and I still feel that she finds a coldness in hugging
CAM,WI,She doesn't like to hug
LAJUAN,IN,H No My family's not very much hugging
CAM,WI,Oh
LAJUAN,IN,I mean my whole life we've never been very you greet someone you don't s hug them You're just like VOX hi VOX how are you and even like male female H You don't do it
CAM,WI,See uh my my mother was like that more so
LAJUAN,IN,THROAT
CAM,WI,H And then my father was different
LAJUAN,IN,Very emotional Very hugging
CAM,WI,Yeah very hugging they were just H See my family is more
LAJUAN,IN,THROAT
CAM,WI,it's it's different It's like
LAJUAN,IN,Mm
CAM,WI,each member of the family is slightly different and different a amount of touch
LAJUAN,IN,H I always said that if I had children I would always Especially if I had a son I would hug him just so he knew that I loved him
CAM,WI,Right I think it's important I think it's good
LAJUAN,IN,THROAT
CAM,WI,I don't think you can overly hug H um with family and stuff like that
LAJUAN,IN,Yeah See and that's how I feel is that H I want to hug him because I want him to know that I do love him
CAM,WI,Mhm
LAJUAN,IN,And that I I I want my children if I if I ever had children H to know H that there is nothing wrong with showing physical affection between two men It doesn't make you gay
CAM,WI,Right
LAJUAN,IN,You know and that is one of the things that Scott was saying yesterday it really bothered Scott a lot because his nephew H uh kept calling him Aunt Scott Because and his nephew was just being rude and obnoxious about every gift H he he unwrapped and his brother said H oh that's just the way kids are today and I'm like H no that's the way you train your kids H If you don't train your kids to be any better then they are and see and in Scott's family like his brother his older brother'll say oh Scott's my best friend H But he'll tease Scott about oh why aren't you married You know you must be a fag Or this H and he'll laugh it off H and he doesn't realize well yeah Scott is gay H and it hurts Scott
CAM,WI,He doesn't know that he's gay
LAJUAN,IN,THROAT Hm-mm
CAM,WI,THROAT
LAJUAN,IN,Has no idea He's probably he's gonna drop him off which is why I have to close those blinds soon H But uh Hx H it it's the way he is And his brother is just like that And so he and h and so his little boy is growing up the same way Larry's twelve H And he's like this big kid cause he's overweight And I told Scott I said well Scott H I wouldn't take it personal cause Scott was telling me this morning I said H first of all Larry's twelve years old he's like six foot one and he's fat I mean he's just probably a good two hundred fifty pounds I said
CAM,WI,He's six one At twelve
LAJUAN,IN,At twelve years old
CAM,WI,Oh that's scary
LAJUAN,IN,And he's like two hundred and fifty pounds H And I said Scott he's compensating H for the fact I said I bet you the kids pick on him I said he's different H I said so therefore H he probably is a big bully at school And I said so he's probably just like this kid who's just like H real H bitter H because nobody And I said his dad is just an a a jerk Scott's brother H will call our house and just is just rude to Scott H But yet he'll turn around and ask Scott to borrow five thousand dollars I mean like he just borrowed twenty-five thousand dollars from Scott H like two years ago and told Scott oh I'll give it back I'm gonna invest it and I'll give it back in three months H So he gives Scott It takes him instead a year and a half to pay Scott back H Like w Scott's got twenty-five thousand dollars just to lay around Like that You know and H that's the way his brother is You know very and he's just he's just mean to Scott He says things to Scott H just like oh just awful things about gay and
CAM,WI,Well why doesn't Scott say something
LAJUAN,IN,TSK H Because Scott hasn't dealt with his gayness himself and he hasn't dealt with who he is
CAM,WI,Mm
LAJUAN,IN,And that's why he doesn't say anything
CAM,WI,So you can't really blame the guy in the sense that
LAJUAN,IN,THROAT
CAM,WI,he doesn't know he's hurting him
LAJUAN,IN,H If Scott doesn't stick up for himself
CAM,WI,Right
LAJUAN,IN,H And I keep telling Scott
CAM,WI,THROAT
LAJUAN,IN,you're gonna have to say something
CAM,WI,THROAT
LAJUAN,IN,H Because all of these things are hurting you
CAM,WI,<VOX Yeah VOX
LAJUAN,IN,And Scott's like oh it doesn't bother me and I'm like then why are you talking about it I said i if that would have been my nephew and he would have said that to me I'd've knocked him across that chair I don't care how big he was
CAM,WI,VOX VOX

CAM,WI,Oh
LAJUAN,IN,It's not open now So he said he'd just rather stay home Instead and I said fine go ahead and stay home
CAM,WI,
LAJUAN,IN,H But I don't know I I really think that it it's hard

CAM,WI,Yeah
LAJUAN,IN,THROAT
CAM,WI,No I couldn't hide it that long either I told my mother when I had like my boyfriend moved away TSK She s
LAJUAN,IN,Is that why you told her
CAM,WI,Mm Cause I was really upset H And then I s And then she's like well it's a good thing he moved away cause he was sort of effeminate and I was really offended
LAJUAN,IN,That's how she took it
CAM,WI,Yeah And I was really offended cause she said something like
LAJUAN,IN,THROAT
CAM,WI,well it's a good thing he was sort of weird I didn't like you hanging around him And I said VOX what do you mean he was weird VOX And she said he was sort of effeminate And I was like well what do you mean he's gay or something she's like well I think he might have been And I said well why does that bother you I said because I am And she's like no You're not I know you You're not gay Hx
LAJUAN,IN,H
CAM,WI,H And I said H yes I am I said how do you know me better than I know myself H And she's just looking at me and she was like really upset H Hx
LAJUAN,IN,Did she tell your dad or did you tell your dad
CAM,WI,TSK No she ended up telling him I think eventually but not right away H First thing I had to go to see a a psychiatrist
LAJUAN,IN,THROAT TSK Oh she made you go do that
CAM,WI,Mhm I went
LAJUAN,IN,Oh Jim's mother told him that too
CAM,WI,TSK See and then I went and the guy's like really nice and he's like well what what's why are you here
LAJUAN,IN,THROAT
CAM,WI,tell me what's what's going on H And I said well
LAJUAN,IN,How old were you at this time
CAM,WI,TSK H Nineteen
LAJUAN,IN,And she X said that's for the X psychiatrist at nineteen She didn't think you knew enough about yourself at that age
CAM,WI,Right Well she didn't want to believe it you know
LAJUAN,IN,THROAT Yeah
CAM,WI,I guess you can't blame em some to some extent H So then I went to the psychiatrist and H he's like well what's the problem and I said well TSK my mother's upset because I'm gay H And he's like well it sounds like she has a problem then H
LAJUAN,IN,H Did he really say that
CAM,WI,VOX Yes VOX He said it sounds like that she's the one with the problem And I didn't even think about how I said it I just said it You know And he interpreted w how I said it as how it was You know w which is true
LAJUAN,IN,H And you know what's really funny is that a psychiatrist would say that
CAM,WI,SNIFF THROAT
LAJUAN,IN,and knowingly know that H you know he accepted the fact that yes you are gay that it is something that H like when Mike told his friend Julia H Mike was telling me that Julia said H oh I don't like it but if that's what you want maybe that's not truly who you are You know and I said to Mike I said then Mike she didn't accept it And he said H well I think she accepted it she just said that H and he told her that he feels he was born with it and she said no I don't believe that I think it's your choice that that's what you want H And I said to And I and I told Mike I said you know H I hate when people say that because if I felt that was my choice H I don't think that would've been the first choice I would've picked
CAM,WI,Oh God no
LAJUAN,IN,H And it's not to say that I'm ashamed of being gay
CAM,WI,No
LAJUAN,IN, what it is is that H because of what society has done or has H laid the rules for us H I don't really think I would have chose to be gay
CAM,WI,THROAT
LAJUAN,IN,I I wouldn't Why would I want to be gay and have to deal with what we go through
CAM,WI,Exactly And that's X what X I explained to my folks now and
LAJUAN,IN,THROAT
CAM,WI,H and they totally believe that it's
LAJUAN,IN,THROAT
CAM,WI,like hereditary or genetic or whatever that it's not a choice You know because
LAJUAN,IN,They do believe it now
CAM,WI,Oh yeah They totally b
LAJUAN,IN,H Oh I believe it's it's I don't know if it's hereditary I do believe it's something H It's a gene or it's something
CAM,WI,Right
LAJUAN,IN,I I don't think I don't care what people say You you are You do not choose
CAM,WI,Unh-unh
LAJUAN,IN,I've known since I was H gosh probably I can remember Four Five years old

CAM,WI,
LAJUAN,IN,And I know it was a sexual arousement cause I can remember feeling sexually interested

LAJUAN,IN,And so I was like four years old So I knew then You you know what you feel inside You you c you can't
CAM,WI,Right
LAJUAN,IN,H And I don't care what anybody says a a f at four years old I pick I chose that That I liked what I saw I don't think so I don't think I knew at four years old H that I could actually just say oh H wow I wanna play with this guy H You know
CAM,WI,Right
LAJUAN,IN,I don't think so And and if they say things like H oh when I was maybe seven I slept with my cousin Tommy who was probably twelve thirteen H At the time and I slept with him no he was sixteen Shared a bed with him and he H uh started fondling me and I enjoyed it and I fondled him back H And I was like seven years old H And I I don't say that he did it to me he molested me or r or raped me as people are saying now H the older uncle H generally I think these kids
CAM,WI,Hm
LAJUAN,IN,not saying adults should've been more responsible my sixteen-year-old cons cousin should have been more responsible
CAM,WI,THROAT
LAJUAN,IN,and not played with a seven-year-old child H but he did H But I'm not gonna turn around and tell my aunt well gee your son molested me as a child

CAM,WI,Right
LAJUAN,IN,H that's why I don't understand where uh they come up with this of H it's your choice It's not I I know H that that's what I felt

LAJUAN,IN,now they live somewhere they just moved cause his wife got a new job H He quit his job for her for her job Cause she moved to California for them cause they were living in Washington DC H So he used to travel all around the world H Well whenever he come to Wisconsin for the dairy expo or he'd come here H go to Chicago for some reason to take businessmen around H what he did was H uh he took f uh farmers around from arou different parts of the world so that they can look at farms H So his travel a lot of times was in Wisconsin because of the farms here H They would see how things were done and he He like took them around TSK the world H You know doing this And he traveled all over the world H See that's why I think Darren now is getting to this point where H he's with Lauren all the time And before Darren traveled like ninety percent of the year He was gone I mean Darren was gone ninety percent of the year So now he's with Lauren every day and it's been this way for the last three or four months H And I think k
CAM,WI,Oh that's all For the last three or four months Oh
LAJUAN,IN,He just started stop They've been married six years He just stopped traveling
CAM,WI,Oh
LAJUAN,IN,And I think now it's just like I don't know if this is for me I don't know if this is right H and he's starting to call me And he's starting to tell me how much he cares for me and how he has feelings for me and I H I know that you're with Scott H And I'm just like and I'm not giving up my life for you H He asked me once right out of college when he moved to Washington DC when I came back from California and I was here and I had just started working H he asked me to move to Madison To be with him That was when he was on the peak of thinking maybe I am gay H And I said well why don't I come out there first and we'll see So I went out there H and he goes H well yeah you can move out here and get your own apartment whereas he owned a three-bedroom house and lived by himself and I'm like okay can I afford to move out here get a apartment until I find He never said move in here with me until you find a place or whatever H It was just like H and then he wanted the still straight life and this and that and other So now he claims bisexuality H but he's moving closer I think X to steps of being X gay H because when he was talking to me on the phone last week he was telling me how much he still loved me And he doesn't know what to do about this whole situation
CAM,WI,How could he really love you though he doesn't know you that much
LAJUAN,IN,H He doesn't know me because in the last ten years H we talked to each other maybe once a month
CAM,WI,Well that's quite a bit though
LAJUAN,IN,And actually maybe not even that Sometimes it's every other month When he was traveling around the world H like he went to Germany for six weeks And he sent me his frequent flyer ticket H Cause he was there training to t speak learning to speak German in a six-week course H And he sent me
CAM,WI,THROAT
LAJUAN,IN,a free k to to come and spend a week with him and I said no H But at that time I would been with Scott like four years and I was just like Hx I don't think so You're not gonna use me for your little sex thing for that H week and then that's it so TSK H I mean I st I love him I really do but
CAM,WI,P Hm P
LAJUAN,IN,I don't H I also don't trust him I don't think any man H who is as sexual as he w is and traveled as much as he did could stay celibate or or stay t t committed to his wife
CAM,WI,Right
LAJUAN,IN,I mean when y I saw him once in Chicago I went to Chicago About four years ago Five years ago And he was in Chicago in this VOX really nice VOX hotel and he H said why don't you come and you know I'm free Saturday and Sunday Why don't you come And I said fine So I took the train to Chicago on Saturday H and I thought okay no big deal he'll have a room with two double beds No it was a king-size bed H So I thought okay no big deal I took a sleeping bag just in case H So here I am taking my sleeping bag I roll it out on the floor and he goes H Hx well you don't have to worry you can share this bed with me I love Lauren and No I take that back H It was more than five years ago because he's been married to Lauren for six years this coming May no Seven years this coming May H So it was more than six years ago because it was when he asked Lauren to marry him it was right around Christmas time H So it's been about six and a half years so H he asked Lauren to marry him H and he says I really love Lauren X I'm gonna marry her and blah blah blah this H So I get in the bed I thought fine no big deal I'm wearing my t-shirt and my underwear so I get in the bed H and in the morning I wake up and here he is fondling me TSK So I'm like okay so do you leave or what do you do You know so I'm like Darren he goes just don't say anything And I said Darren this isn't right you don't really want to be with me you just want the sexual part And I said that's all there is to it and I just can't do this And he accepted it and I I don't know He always and he'll always ask me H well how's Scott H how is your sex life with Scott Are you happy with Scott you know do you still miss me H And I'm like well Darren I haven't told you I missed you in years What are you talking about
CAM,WI,Hx
LAJUAN,IN,You know it's like k excuse me H
CAM,WI,Is he like full of himself or what
LAJUAN,IN,TSK H And he's another one too
CAM,WI,THROAT
LAJUAN,IN,He knows he's good-looking He he's another one When we were were in college he knew it
CAM,WI,Mm
LAJUAN,IN,And and what really gets me is th that TSK H I think the reason I always attracted like I attracted a lot of football players H is people always got the impression I was gay H So if they knew you were gay and they wanted some experience and they H they didn't want to approach another say man in your frat H And they kinda thought you were gay and nobody really wanted to H like say it they would approach me
CAM,WI,Mm
LAJUAN,IN,H So I always got all the good-looking ones to always like come after me
CAM,WI,P Mm P
LAJUAN,IN,And that's how I ended up with Ron and how I ended up with Darren And I and I realize that H you know I always think well especially Ron I mean he was just like oh just perfect Well Darren was too but H Darren H a lot of people don't like auburn hair or reddish brown hair They don't ca care for it But Ron just is just a H just a beautiful man They both were but H I find that that's what happens in these fraternities Is you find a man who is curious about his sexuality H And if they find someone who they question okay is he gay or isn't he gay H then they will tend to go after you a little bit faster H So then you think okay you've seen some of these guys in the bars and you think TSK like I was out at the Triangle and I saw this guy he was so good-looking I'm like
CAM,WI,THROAT
LAJUAN,IN,H how the hell did he end up with that VOX thing VOX H And then I thought you know I betcha he's just out And he was from Marquette H and he was just finding out and he met this guy and that's why he was out with him

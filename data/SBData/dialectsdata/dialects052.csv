CINDY,MT,Unhunh
DARLENE,TX,TSK H And me and about five other people drove around to all these houses to see what they look like

DARLENE,TX,And it worked out good for him otherwise he would've lost the house Eventually he got it back You know H he took it off that and H he got his finances back in order so he didn't lose his house H So it worked out good for him on that and he said the people that all the people that had rented his house H he said Section eight That uh Section eight people kept up good with it And checked on the people But on this other program Hx it didn't look like they did

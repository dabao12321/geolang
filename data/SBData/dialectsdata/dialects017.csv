MICHAEL,MA,Hm TSK yeah
JIM,NA,And even if I go out and ask for it you know I say Q can I copy that Q I won't feel guilty I really won't It's just a set of instructions I used to program H a little bit and H and um TSK H those guys have so much fun writing those programs you know that's the I think that's that's pretty
MICHAEL,MA,TSK H Yeah well
JIM,NA,That's pretty much the end of it
MICHAEL,MA,creative people generally do what they love to do
JIM,NA,H Yeah right And that's pretty much the end of the truthful part of the process H The rest of it is all marketing
MICHAEL,MA,Hm
JIM,NA,and the marketplace is uh you know maybe I think I live in Tangiers H you know Maybe I think the marketplace is uh
MICHAEL,MA,
JIM,NA,H you get what you can get
MICHAEL,MA,yeah
JIM,NA,Hx Uh H seems to be that way you know I as long as I'm not hurting another person directly H
MICHAEL,MA,Right
JIM,NA,You know or even indirectly H but just throwing my money out there he may never see a penny of it he may have sold the rights H outright H You know
MICHAEL,MA,H
JIM H T,MA,at certainly happens in music
JIM,NA,H Heavens yes I yeah
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah
JIM,NA,You know I mean it happens all over the place
MICHAEL,MA,You know I wish I was uh the person whose voice they used in the telephone when it tells you the number has been changed H And that I had uh copyright get some royalties Like H that lady you know h you hear H Q the number you have reached da-duh da-duh da-duh da-duh da-duh da-duh Q
JIM,NA,they got a different woman didn't they
MICHAEL,MA,Hunh
JIM,NA,didn't they get a different woman When she th tried to do that
MICHAEL,MA,I don't know if they did
JIM,NA,they they they hired another voice
MICHAEL,MA,I didn't hear any follow-up but
JIM,NA,that's what I thought that they did anyways
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah hunh they certainly use her a lot But I mean it they only use what a s five seconds total or something You know it's a H
JIM,NA,TSK Probably took her a long time to H TSK to say every possible combination
MICHAEL,MA,H oh but they the computer does that All she has to do is say each digit and the computer
JIM,NA,Oh that's all it is
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah it's like a series of samples
JIM,NA,And it automatically sorts em
MICHAEL,MA,Unhunh
JIM,NA,Yeah
MICHAEL,MA,right yeah H so it's H Probably the total actual s speaking that they use is pretty short It would be much more pleasant if they had done all the combinations though H You know call it up and there's something that actually says your number in toto You know
JIM,NA,Yeah Or because it recognizes your phone number it automatically goes into the computer finds that
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah
JIM,NA,and a and names the name
MICHAEL,MA,that sample
JIM,NA,H Q Thank you Mister Smith for calling Pacific Bell Q
MICHAEL,MA,yeah right You know H
JIM,NA,Q I am your personal computer representative Q H
MICHAEL,MA,That'd be great
JIM,NA,H
MICHAEL,MA,
JIM,NA,Q Push one if you wish to know my phone number push two if you wish to h Q
MICHAEL,MA,H My phone number X that I X
JIM,NA,you know have dinner with me push three
MICHAEL,MA,H H
JIM,NA,if you want to uh H h
MICHAEL,MA,Artificial intelligence personality that you call up
JIM,NA,@Yeah  so H Q if you do not like this personality push zero and a new personality
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah H
JIM,NA,will be provided for you
MICHAEL,MA,%Yeah
JIM,NA,at no extra charge
MICHAEL,MA,%Yeah Hunh
JIM,NA,H Q You are allowed up to five personalities in one phone call Q H
MICHAEL,MA,
JIM,NA,H well the networking of computers is getting uh such that you know TSK almost anything's possible H Any XX
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah that's why I X like it X
JIM,NA,It's just matrixing and H just con constantly building and building upon building upon building on these complexities and building controllers for them
MICHAEL,MA,That's right X and X
JIM,NA,and building on top of those
MICHAEL,MA,And you're building on the thoughts of th your predecessors
JIM,NA,H
MICHAEL,MA,but your predecessors in this case could be like last year
JIM,NA,H
MICHAEL,MA,You know it's like it's moving so fast
JIM,NA,Oh So fast
MICHAEL,MA,H It's like a r-
JIM,NA,Hx
MICHAEL,MA,It's a reflection of the brain and it's communication like books but it's much quicker And it's like
JIM,NA,X but X when they get
MICHAEL,MA,if you can think of something and define it you can make it happen If it just about information I mean you can't
JIM,NA,H If it's just about information that's very true
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah You can't conjure something up like a car out of nothing But TSK H
JIM,NA,well with the superconductors uh that's gonna make it you know so economical
MICHAEL,MA,mhm
JIM,NA,for everybody to have all the electronic this and that that they want because there'll be so little loss of electricity
MICHAEL,MA,TSK Yeah And it'll be small
JIM,NA,You know and it It'll be f so small that we'll have enormous amount uh we should have an enormous supply of it
MICHAEL,MA,H yeah like every light switch will have its own computer or something you know Basically because it'll be cheap enough that cheap as a switch these days or something
JIM,NA,it won't cost anything
MICHAEL,MA,you know
JIM,NA,ky and it and when they go into outer space and start growing this thi those uh H silicon chips without any flaws
MICHAEL,MA,Hm
JIM,NA,H they'll be able to uh grow circuitry that is so complicated H that you know that gravity destroys it so they'll be able to uh
MICHAEL,MA,Hm
JIM,NA,H uh
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah
JIM,NA,to i they'll be able to get these fantastic uh circuits H f like say for a whole television set just on one chip H And uh
MICHAEL,MA,H
JIM,NA,uh and then it'll harden out there and k they'll bring it back H a uh the whole thing is s
MICHAEL,MA,Hx
JIM,NA,is s is so sensational
MICHAEL,MA,TSK That'll be expensive at first
JIM,NA,God But can you
MICHAEL,MA,growing em in space but that's great
JIM,NA,yeah it'll it'll uh it'll be worth it
MICHAEL,MA,In H This technology out of most of uh m anything in the past ha has m it's becoming like we're shaping our our destiny X or X ourselves um with this technology more than we have in with any other in the past it seems H just b_like whatever we think it b we can make it H but there's one technology that's um gonna overtake that and that's DNA research which is like a total scam at this point still it's they're just like bombarding H rganisms with radiation to see what comes up H you know We have very little control over it But once we do H we'll be able to program biology as well
JIM,NA,H TSK Well that's pretty frightening concept
MICHAEL,MA,TSK H It is frightening but
JIM,NA,We can't even control our freeways
MICHAEL,MA,um H I know
JIM,NA,you know
MICHAEL,MA,H
JIM,NA,I mean
MICHAEL,MA,but i the thing is any s technology that comes up it gets used Once it's out there in the open
JIM,NA,H
MICHAEL,MA,the
JIM,NA,Well I hope
MICHAEL,MA,the society as a a whole
JIM I h,MA,pe they use fractals
JIM,NA,Are you familiar with fractals
MICHAEL,MA,Unhunh
JIM,NA,Yeah I hope they use a lot of fractals Because f
MICHAEL,MA,in biology research
JIM,NA,% No But in well the connection between mathematics and biology can be found k
MICHAEL,MA,unhunh
JIM,NA,uh more easily with fractals than it can with uh regular mathematics
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah
JIM,NA,H
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah
JIM,NA,So H you know I'm looking for the p connection between science and H and religion and and and and biology
MICHAEL,MA,mhm
JIM,NA,as it were ar th you know the living as spiritual and the and the
MICHAEL,MA,Like the ancient science were
JIM,NA,and the sci and the scientific Pardon
MICHAEL,MA,it was like the ancient science it was just a branch of knowledge which is included all knowledge basically
JIM,NA,Alchemy alchemy Right
MICHAEL,MA,H Unhunh
JIM,NA,H yeah
MICHAEL,MA,H Whatever gets the job done
JIM,NA,The the- the gestalt
MICHAEL,MA,@
JIM,NA,the totality is taken into account as opposed to H as opposed to the observer
MICHAEL,MA,Right
JIM,NA,H you know H I remember m back in the psychedelic days there was this poster of the scientist I've always been on a kind of a crusade for scientific uh H responsibility Right H And scientists are H are taking such control over the world these days H uh with their n you know not the scientists but what they've invented H And the way it's marketed and the way we're d we develop needs for it H And I remember this pf cartoon I saw w of of it was called The Scientist H and it had this this wonderful stone statue about twenty stories tall of a naked man and a naked woman H intertwined with each other hugging each other full frontal and their arms wrapped around each other H and then they s they they looked like they were so intertwined and they spiraled down and and they're a s they're a statue H right
MICHAEL,MA,Hm
JIM,NA,made out of stone and they're H and the whole base of the statue is crumbling Right H And it's just like rubble f like from just below the knees H down was just kind of rubble but the rest of it was all real clear a few ttle some of it was chipped off you know it was old but H and d and down at the bottom of this this rubble was this little man H who was a scientist And he had this big magnifying glass H and he was looking at the rubble Looking with his head down
MICHAEL,MA,Hm
JIM,NA,not looking up at the statue and seeing the love and the the the symbol there H but looking down at the crumbs H you know
MICHAEL,MA,Hm
JIM,NA,H at the rubble at the bottom With his magnifying glass H and and to me that that always symbolized kind of rather clearly H the limitations of the scientific method H Whi if it doesn't take into account
MICHAEL,MA,well
JIM,NA,the to the the the whole human experience H and including H the unbelievable parts of it the parts that are just legend and myth and H and uh alluded to
MICHAEL,MA,you mean the theories
JIM,NA,and and the psychedelic experiences and the H subjective
MICHAEL,MA,oh on that side
JIM,NA,you know and insanity and
MICHAEL,MA,H
JIM,NA,What I mean
MICHAEL,MA,well
JIM,NA,you know they
MICHAEL,MA,
JIM,NA,They've got to take ac into account
MICHAEL,MA,Hx
JIM,NA,H uh
MICHAEL,MA,but you can't
JIM,NA,the East with all its with all its fantastic discoveries
MICHAEL,MA,but you can't look at the stars with a microscope TSK And science is a microscope Each p_scientist has their H their field of um expertise and if they're gonna go if they're gonna stretch out far enough into the the unknown where they can find something new H They have to do it in a straight line They can't do it
JIM,NA,that's true
MICHAEL,MA,H in all directions at once Because then you run into things that we already know H So the problem is communication between s
JIM,NA,but they're doing it they're doing it with mathematics Right I mean
MICHAEL,MA,Well
JIM,NA,n no
MICHAEL,MA,but the comm- problem is communication between the branches of science
JIM,NA,mhm
MICHAEL,MA,I think
JIM,NA,TSK that's true
MICHAEL,MA,cause H who's gonna be able to hold all that knowledge and make the connections
JIM,NA,H Well the philosophers and the spiritual leaders and I mean cause f the stuff can be understand understood The goals
MICHAEL,MA,H Those people can tell you
JIM,NA,or the or the cutting cutting edge can be understand understood intellectually H
MICHAEL,MA,but those people can't tell you the details they know the whole structure but see
JIM,NA,well the
MICHAEL,MA,it's like both sides You have to have somebody looking at the details
JIM,NA,y got to have a leader
MICHAEL,MA,and somebody looking at the H
JIM,NA,and you got to have a bunch of workers H You know
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah
JIM,NA,And you gotta have somebody
MICHAEL,MA,right
JIM,NA,who d_isn't necessarily inclined to deal with the details that much H who's guiding those who are willing to sit there
MICHAEL,MA,I guess that's the problem
JIM,NA,and make all the
MICHAEL,MA,we don't have a guider
JIM,NA,H yeah there's no l there's no lead or there's no focus
MICHAEL,MA,yeah
JIM,NA,H and
MICHAEL,MA,That's right
JIM,NA,and uh you know I think I think that one of the reasons that there's been no focus is because H h everybody accepted the scientific method as the best tool that we have H And was kinda letting the scientific method be the
MICHAEL,MA,Mhm
JIM,NA,be the leader H The the w you know just continue inventorying and
MICHAEL,MA,Well those people who are doing research
JIM,NA,continue inventorying cataloging experimenting You know TSK documenting uh uh whatever H and instead of instead of uh uh coming at it from another direction Trying to find trying to find uh trying to find ways to H to like with with Einstein for example you know H uh it seemed to me he was trying to f T_he was ex per experimenting with H with new ways of doing things you know
MICHAEL,MA,X well X thinking about things
JIM,NA,H h uh and thinking about things and he was trying to he w I think he was ultimately trying to trying to discover the speed of his own thought H
MICHAEL,MA,Hm
JIM,NA,You know H X I mean X he was like really off into wonderful abstract notions that were all based in a peaceful world
MICHAEL,MA,H
JIM,NA,You know H that couldn't exist unless he was secure that we had a peaceful world or that that peace was H part of it Of what he was about H and H so much of today's technology is soulless and has nothing to do with peace it has to do with H just generally chewing up you know consumerism basically and
MICHAEL,MA,Mhm
JIM,NA,H chewing up ch n j chewing up new w uh chewing up the human experience and turning it into H some kind of consumer need
MICHAEL,MA,Did you ever get into Tesla
JIM,NA,H uh just .e+ver so peripherally
MICHAEL,MA,He had a lot of real wacky ideas on big levels He wanted a world power system H that you could um tap into the air basically and get power anywhere on earth H and um H y
JIM,NA,that's what the Tesla coil was about
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah but e the problem was that it it uh H it interfered with um SWALLOW well matter I mean y it was not a clean broadcast system Like everything in the room if you had a Tesla coil in the middle of the room all the metal objects would be receiving it constantly
JIM,NA,Mhm
MICHAEL,MA,H So it wasn't really a very efficient either Because you'd have to have a H an immense amount of power being broadcast so that a few points could receive you know their share of it TSK H
JIM,NA,now what about if they  with the superconductor Will that change all that
MICHAEL,MA,TSK I don't know He was dealing with it being basically energy and being sent through the air uh you know like light
JIM,NA,like yeah Like tapping right into just the energy of the earth or something X alright X
MICHAEL,MA,yeah which doesn't really require a conductor
JIM,NA,yeah may-
MICHAEL,MA,you know I mean light will go through a vacuum So I think he was H I mean he va basically invented the radio and stuff like that you know H
JIM,NA,H It's pretty confusing to me Hx but uh yeah those those guys are the guys I think that are the heroes uh or that are the unsung heroes H
MICHAEL,MA,yeah
JIM,NA,You know the r the uh H and s and and business and I mean this is a cliche but but business has always uh taken these works and and manipulated em either to their benefit or to our benefit or to our detriment or something f based on economic H wh what the obvious or the
MICHAEL,MA,hm
JIM,NA,more immediate economic
MICHAEL,MA,TSK Right it's like well gee yeah I know I know how we can make money with this I mean you just do it
JIM,NA,yeah H X Well X that's what I like about fractals is because uh H uh with these new mathematical formulas H
MICHAEL,MA,mhm
JIM,NA,even though you know because it's mathematical and it I it has to work I guess with H numbers in it somew some way H uh it's opens a door into what appears to be all the substance that's underneath the obvious H You know
MICHAEL,MA,hm
JIM,NA,with if if regular math is the obvious H uh these fractals seem to seem to represent everything that numbers aren't H and uh that's
MICHAEL,MA,TSK Well something that numbers aren't I don't think it's everything
JIM,NA,TSK not everything but s
MICHAEL,MA,cause there are t
JIM,NA,but the first window into that
MICHAEL,MA,yeah H well it like every theory is just like it's a window and it's also like a model of um reality and it's really not reality H And uh like a fractal can get really close at do like describing growth patterns like a plant or something
JIM,NA,Yes Yes Right Right
MICHAEL,MA,H Um but H it's still n not the totality of a plant
JIM,NA,No it isn't by any stretch But for mathematics or for science it's the it's an opportunity for them to
MICHAEL,MA,it's the closest thing we have
JIM,NA,H to yeah To get closer to H to the chaos or the or the order of chaos
MIC,NA,AEL Mhm Uh H that exists uh H uh a h as subtext to our life to our experience on this planet And when we're
MICHAEL,MA,Mm
JIM,NA,H and when we're say when we're going to H uh say blow up the first atomic bomb H and and and we don't bother to ask the American people or the people of the world if w if if we mind
MICHAEL,MA,
JIM,NA,H uh if there's a chance you know cause they didn't know for sure whether it would destroy the universe or not
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah H Or not
JIM H A,MA,d H It might have started a chain reaction that just blew up the whole earth
JIM,NA,That's right And it might very well still have started that chain reaction And that it's all happening in fractal country H and it has
MICHAEL,MA,Aah
JIM,NA,and it and it's manifesting itself in H in disharmony H uh in H in the deterioration of the planet We're all worried about the ozone we're all worried about the uh H
MICHAEL,MA,Hm
JIM,NA,uh H th cancer is everywhere H uh
MICHAEL,MA,so you're saying it might have done the same bad thing but in a sort of more roundabout way
JIM,NA,it's just that the uni except that the universe is such a complex phenomenon that it's so deep it's for f the fabric that we are witnessing through m science and through any known ability to understand
MICHAEL,MA,Mm
JIM,NA,H is just a thin shell from how deep H this phantasmagorical experience goes H and that when they did that it's possible that they started a chain reaction at such a subatomic level a sub sub sub sub subatomic level
MICHAEL,MA,it's gonna take a while to crumble
JIM,NA,H that it'll take a while before it it H it really H you know vr goes ROAR you know and just rips it apart
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah
JIM,NA,it might take H it might take a a few th it might take five hundred years or a thousand years
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah
JIM,NA,or a hundred years or maybe it's be w maybe in v fifty years H or it might never happen but H it's to me H that was scientific irresponsibility H And w without the knowledge of of f what fractals symbolize at this point to me H  uh they w they could make that decision easier And H with the scientif
MICHAEL,MA,fractals could have made the decision easier
JIM,NA,H No No Without the knowledge of fractals The decision was made easier If fractals were known at that time
MICHAEL,MA,oh
JIM,NA,H there might have been a little more caution because there was H there's this window
MICHAEL,MA,but fractals don't uh don't imply any particular morals
JIM,NA,H well they imply no they don't imply morals but they do imply that there's more than the obvious going on
MICHAEL,MA,Well all math does that
JIM,NA,Uh not to me uh X it's X
MICHAEL,MA,They're just another system that's all just another model
JIM,NA,it's to me it's a model it's it's a model into the fourth dimension as opposed to H you know
MICHAEL,MA,Well actually
JIM,NA,the third dimension
MICHAEL,MA,Einstein's theory is a model in the fourth dimension and that's time H Um but fractal can be applied to many dimensions or n or just I mean any number of dimensions it's basically H taking something and dividing it up randomly or with some system H it's like nested H nested values basically Inside a gallon you have four quarts inside of four in inside a quart you have the certain amount of cups and then you know H etcetera etcetera H
JIM,NA,TSK H well
MICHAEL,MA,I don't see how it's
JIM,NA,yeah except it's not it's not uh it's not so it's not squared and it's not as predictable as that I mean it's uh H it's it's not predictable at all really It's it's a it's a found phenomenon
MICHAEL,MA,H Well it's not predictable if you apply random values to the subdivisions
JIM,NA,The subdivisions have to be random They ha it has to have randomness to it H the order I don't think is is understood yet I mean I might be wrong but that's my understanding
MICHAEL,MA,Hm TSK H well I think
JIM,NA,SMOKING that's why they're calling it the equ they're calling it uh H the mathematics of chaos SMOKING
MICHAEL,MA,Oh that's a different thing That's not fractals Hx
JIM,NA,Yeah that's fractals H SMOKING It includes other
MICHAEL,MA,well fractals can be used to describe chaos
JIM,NA,it includes it includes SMOKING> other it i Yes It can And it includes other mathematics too
MICHAEL,MA,But fractals is separate X yeah X I mean and chaos is se they overlap
JIM,NA,Mhm
MICHAEL,MA,H Chaos X I guess X is basically analysis of noise
JIM,NA,For for the scientist For the scientist the scientist has never hav has never had a tool where he had that overlap you see H
MICHAEL,MA,Hm
JIM,NA,see that's w that's the point that I'm trying to get at is is that H because the scientific method now has that tool of overlap it's giving them something that they never had before
MICHAEL,MA,Hm
JIM,NA,and that is an opportunity for to meet spirituality
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah well there's u
JIM,NA,in physics
MICHAEL,MA,There's opportunities to meet spirituality twenty-four hours a day wherever you go H just by being alive H If they don't wanna see it they're not gonna see it in fractals
JIM,NA,Well yeah a lot of people will A lot of people will uh it'll dawn on them because they follow the scientific impulse H and fractals may be the very thing that boggles them out enough where they have to do some serious questioning about things is my theory
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah
JIM,NA,You know
MICHAEL,MA,Maybe They'll probably find it in something if there fractals weren't there H I think um H it's like all the the ideas that we have throughout the ages and the various H they're just sort of echos of uh the past And they come under different names and things Just like um H the latest power now is corporations Right And before that it was like uh governments before that it was principalities H before that it was gangs you know
JIM,NA,And tribes
MICHAEL,MA,And gangs are coming back now you know s but uh
JIM,NA,God are they ever
MICHAEL,MA,H um
JIM,NA,it's unbelievable
MICHAEL,MA,And knowledge and and the pursuit of um spirituality has taken on many forms
JIM,NA,COUGH
MICHAEL,MA,And if a person wants to find it in in something they believe in and they believe in science they'll find it in science
JIM,NA,well that's very true but I mean uh that I think that that that people who find spirituality in science as their f sole spiritual H source are H people that are fucking up the planet H You know I don't think science is the I don't think science can be God H I've been watching Two Thousand And One lately You know I mean that's what that's all i that's not what it's all about but that's a H a major theme in it you know that the race between the human and the and the techno
MICHAEL,MA,mhm
JIM,NA,and its and its technological H manifestation of H well I you know I think that we built Hx
MICHAEL,MA,it's like are we gonna be part of it or are we gonna make it
JIM,NA,H Is it gonna m do us or are we gonna do it you know H is our creation it's like the Frankenstein myth H Is our creation going to uh H destroy us or are we going to continue
MICHAEL,MA,Yeah uh look at what's on TV
JIM,NA,yeah I just put it on
MICHAEL,MA,H Mandelbrot oh
JIM,NA,I just put it on
MICHAEL,MA,okay
JIM,NA,Yeah
MICHAEL,MA,I see TSK I thought they were showing that on the uh ads for some reason
JIM,NA,
MICHAEL,MA,H
JIM,NA,H
MICHAEL,MA,A little too hip for TV
JIM,NA,H Little too hip yeah
MICHAEL,MA,So they're color-cycling right now Does it zoom later I guess it must
JIM,NA,H Yeah I've got zooms on here too TSK and I
MICHAEL,MA,Where'd you tape it from
JIM,NA,M_TSK uh This one's Fractal Fantasy which is for sale
MICHAEL,MA,Hunh
JIM,NA,and the other one is uh Fractal Zooms which I don't think is available H BURP b and then I've got a uh test film from IBM laboratories of uh f uh H uh H taking a Julia set into the fourth dimension
MICHAEL,MA,Hm

PHIL,NA,But H X But X anyways back to the the first thing
BRAD,NA,Okay
PHIL,NA,what we were talking about was
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,H
BRAD,NA,I've gotta pick up Pat
PHIL,NA,Hx
BRAD,NA,I l I dropped her off at the bookkeeper
PHIL,NA,WRITING
BRAD,NA,H Uh
PHIL,NA,TSK Uh I would prefer that WRITING that you were there on one hand because I think that it would be most expedient But I think H what was felt was that at this point rather than ha than create H TSK I don't really f find it to be you know a confrontation by any means but H
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,I just think they wanna be able to just kind of figure out I think our board eh quite frankly we have more problems to resolve interior than we do H TSK outside of it
BRAD,NA,Hm
PHIL,NA,I think most of it is just attitudes
BRAD,NA,Hm
PHIL,NA,H I think you know like I said what we need to do is this board has to realize in my opinion that that they have to come to grips with H the fact that they are responsible for basically what they've created
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,Okay You know H
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,You can't th penalize somebody for m-
BRAD,NA,H And the Vetters are somewhat responsible
PHIL,NA,H That's right
BRAD,NA,H and that's uh 
PHIL,NA,X Mhm X>
BRAD,NA,well it was far beyond our control
PHIL,NA,TSK H Well and the thing is I mean
BRAD,NA,H That uh
PHIL,NA,we're we're a different board We are not the same
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,And we have to do that
BRAD,NA,H That's right
PHIL,NA,but we have to realize that there's H the faults here we have to claim responsibilities H I mean
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,I think there was there's manners of of speaking that I was very outspoken about at this meeting you know w that I talked to H uh Bill and Carmela and Nancy about you know and they X we did they asked me to meet with them about Teresa's thing
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,H that I find v really nothing to be honest nothing of any validity
BRAD,NA,H Well I you know
PHIL,NA,Okay
BRAD,NA,I have spoken twice with Teresa
PHIL,NA,Did you Unhunh
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,H
BRAD,NA,And I told her exactly well i t I simply told her what H what I know to have happ and I it's to me it's n just ludicrous and I H anyway we w we went through the whole thing and H uh and and I also said that it would probably be brought up at board retreat or D_I don't know Uh
PHIL,NA,H Well I I'm gonna write a letter to Teresa
BRAD,NA,H Uh THROAT H um H
PHIL,NA,just to tell her that l you know d Thank you for your l you know y what you've done for the board and so forth
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,and just say you know I'm hoping we are gonna address this letter of concerns that you've given us H
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,Um Hx she's asked Hx that you know she want she didn't really want her things to be kind of everywhere You know those th
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,what her comments She really wanted em to be within this TAP p committee TAP H
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,my f
BRAD,NA,Summarized or X something like that I guess X>
PHIL,NA,S they were her summar- her summary th you know She kyu very m very concisely
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,I don't know if she put it together or if nancy put it together But
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,H you know that just says they I d I really had a ho everybody there including Nancy H
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,You know Uh had very little to to H you know to agree with the validity Okay
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,It was a matter of I just don't you know see where this is coming from
BRAD,NA,Yeah It's H
PHIL,NA,H Okay you know these are these are rooted
BRAD,NA,I know Jeez
PHIL,NA,obviously in a personal H issue H
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,Um Teresa is a very sensitive person she f you know I don't I have no doubt that she believes what happened happened H But
BRAD,NA,H Well but
PHIL,NA,My my feeling is as I told them I said H if it's that issue I says you know I said let's just get real here I said
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,we all know Brad H I said we all know Teresa I said and I don't know anybody on this board who does not tiptoe around Teresa Period
BRAD,NA,Yeah Unhunh
PHIL,NA,H I says I don't know anybody who would even go as far as to say anything of that nature I said H and there it was very clear You know She kept saying prefacing everything with H you know this is not a personal attack This is not a personal H vendetta
BRAD,NA,Yeah yeah yeah yeah Right Right
PHIL,NA,H Which tells you that it is
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,That's immediately what it said And that's what everybody perceived it
BRAD,NA,Yeah H There
PHIL,NA,H
BRAD,NA,Yeah there have been some uh I'll te well it goes back to if you can believe it I ha H I know she there was a a We had a number of people once at a party H uh like half of the board it was a big mistake of mine
PHIL,NA,Yeah
BRAD,NA,H and I know she felt really snubbed and uh
PHIL,NA,Mhm
BRAD,NA,H and it was and I I called her in fact later And I said Teresa H Thi this was not a w I invited people that helped with the market that year
PHIL,NA,Mhm I think it was two years ago H And I know I mean that wa really upset her And jeez If that's gonna upset her H Uh
PHIL,NA,TSK H Well that's that's the thing that
BRAD,NA,H but anyway
PHIL,NA,that see and the other thing that I've gotta do too is I wanna make sure like for example H Donna's aware that she is not gonna be at this retreat
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,See I have not called her but I'm gonna call her to tell her that
BRAD,NA,Mhm Yeah
PHIL,NA,You know we're having a board retreat you know
BRAD,NA,Right that it's not gonna include staff if that's what we decide
BRAD,NA,Right Unhunh
PHIL,NA,H And what we will do Hx is I think what we're gonna probably wanna do or what I would like to do is I would like to take a day
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,H d during the week and we'll just take a whole day That day And myself H uh if we have a uh facilitator
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,H Um that that person you and Patricia and D Donna
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,and maybe one other or two other board members would actually spend that day and just say okay this is what went on at that retreat
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,H These X are the X concerns
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,H These were comments these are the ones that we feel we can address These are the ones that pertain to you
BRAD,NA,Unhunh Yeah
PHIL,NA,H 
BRAD,NA,H I I am concerned Phil that H you mentioned it yesterday That that there may be a number of questions that just cannot be answered Without me being there
PHIL,NA,Yeah
BRAD,NA,I I I think it's
PHIL,NA,Hi L gato L>
BRAD,NA,H You know I'm gonna have
PHIL,NA,Okay
BRAD,NA,H Can we talk l uh I bet Pat's gonna she's gonna start walking back to the office
PHIL,NA,Yeah
BRAD,NA,H I dropped her at the bookkeeper
PHIL,NA,W w why don't you call me at least a little bit later maybe
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,and we can <X go X do that
BRAD,NA,Can I do that H Cause I she'll be
PHIL,NA,Hx Ji Jim and I are gonna have lunch
BRAD,NA,Uh I don't want to get her uh
PHIL,NA,I don't know if you have plans or not But we're gonna have lunch later
BRAD,NA,H
PHIL,NA,at noon
BRAD,NA,Sure hx
PHIL,NA,If you wanna join us it'd be great
BRAD,NA,sure Yeah
PHIL,NA,H um
BRAD,NA,you wanna do it where what's the
PHIL,NA,I you know I don't my my feeling is I'm trying to I think H what I wanna do is my my point of wanting to push this retreat I think it was really important was
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,to do it to e H to make it sound like we're taking it seriously
BRAD,NA,Oh yeah
PHIL,NA,But to also put into perspective and see w that was one point of view why
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,you know Like I said d d the facilitator in in the beginning I did not wasn't really in support of one And only because I felt
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,H I wanna make it sound important
BRAD,NA,It would formalize it too much Or 
PHIL,NA,H I want it formalizing it but it's also say I want it to come to the resolution that things aren't that bad
BRAD,NA,Mhm TSK H No
PHIL,NA,and that what
BRAD,NA,I
PHIL,NA,what we and things aren't that bad The thing is that we h do have our attitudes
BRAD,NA,Mhm Mhm
PHIL,NA,H Okay
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA, We have an attitude you know even what Ray's attitude with with Barbara
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,H is completely unheard of you know and I'm that bothers me a great deal
BRAD,NA,Jeez I just couldn't believe that
PHIL,NA,H
BRAD,NA,When I heard it
PHIL,NA,I  I had you know I came real close to calling Ray and just sitting and talking with him about it
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,but I figured no
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,I'm just gonna blow it off
BRAD,NA,I think he's off the board
PHIL,NA,H I'm gonna blow it off
BRAD,NA,he's
PHIL,NA,H I'm not gonna give m
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,you know we've done everything we needed to do
BRAD,NA,Right
PHIL,NA,H
BRAD,NA,Right
PHIL,NA,I think you know what Barbara told me was that Dolores was incredibly embarrassed by his display at this time in front of her Dolores apologized for Ray to him
BRAD,NA,Really Oh gee
PHIL,NA,H So Dolores is obviously aware that
BRAD,NA,Oh gosh
BRAD,NA,you know and
BRAD,NA,H Yeah
PHIL,NA,she says I don't know why he resigned
BRAD,NA,I don't know what's got X in X
PHIL,NA,because he's been miserable H
BRAD,NA,
PHIL,NA,because w which we know
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,that's why he was kept trying to get involved and make it sound you know like he and n_you know he was trying to make it sound like H same old complaint same old everything well we didn't have any complaints
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,H I think this is one of the first years
BRAD,NA,@I know
PHIL,NA,H that this has been so smooth And I think had we realized it
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,we would have allowed him to take a break four years ago
BRAD,NA,Yeah Yeah
PHIL,NA,H
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,Because and it wasn't so much it wasn't you know like I told Jim I said it wasn't anything H that POUND you POUND did wasn't anything else
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,I said it was a matter of H you know m_Brad did and Pat did the organization I said which was the best thing I th I agree with that
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,I think that was the best thing to do
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,It was a lot of time
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,H But I think we need to we need to d establish duties
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,You know Which we decided And see part of what we decided with these duties is H just deciding what we need to do what You know There's gonna be tasks
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,H
BRAD,NA,H As specifically as we ca
PHIL,NA,H Hx
BRAD,NA,yeah
PHIL,NA,See and I'm I'm Hx on one hand I'd like to take it back to where the secretary is responsible for the minutes
BRAD,NA,THROAT Unhunh
PHIL,NA,You know Pat does that
BRAD,NA,@Yeah H I know H There's really the secretary serves almost no function
PHIL,NA,Just i th not
BRAD,NA,You know I it's just uh
PHIL,NA,There signs she signs her name thirty times
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,you know in the last f y
BRAD,NA,Right  Right Phil
PHIL,NA,two days ago H Well
BRAD,NA,H That was it That was it
PHIL,NA,H That's a problem
BRAD,NA,That um
PHIL,NA,I you know and I think we wanna do that We need to say You know Pat's been great enough to do this and if she really wants to do it I'm not gonna dissuade her from doing it
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,H But one thing we have to be careful of
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,that I mentioned to Jim and I've mentioned it to Pat lightly
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,Which is to be careful about H saying things You know like in board meetings In interjecting too much
BRAD,NA,Yes
PHIL,NA,Okay H
BRAD,NA,I know
PHIL,NA,Because in board discussion I mean
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,o on one hand as a member she has every right To to speak what she wants But
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,H
BRAD,NA,H No But that's
PHIL,NA,The thing is you know I've just seen some of the looks from some of the people you know who feel Q I'm a board member Q
BRAD,NA,TSK Yeah
PHIL,NA,H And whether the board you know if they don't interject anything but whether they do or not I think we have to be careful
BRAD,NA,Mhm H Well Phil that I mean that goes
PHIL,NA,be because where that came in
BRAD,NA,That goes for me as well then It
PHIL,NA,H Yeah it does But
BRAD,NA,It um
PHIL,NA,I think what's different is You
BRAD,NA,um
PHIL,NA,you've been much more responsive in this sense
BRAD,NA,I mean
PHIL,NA,Okay H Pat's more opinionated in that sense
BRAD,NA,You know I Unhunh
PHIL,NA,Okay
BRAD,NA,H I what I try to do is is is just respond to question
PHIL,NA,TSK H X
BRAD,NA,and if I need to fill in blanks which
PHIL,NA,Oh yeah H That's fine
BRAD,NA,You know
PHIL,NA,That
BRAD,NA,But
PHIL,NA,See but that your your position is different
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,H Okay
BRAD,NA,That's Yeah that's true
PHIL,NA,Yours is in a is a much more official capacity because you are the one who answers to the board
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,H
BRAD,NA,Right
PHIL,NA,You have to do that And you are th can voice an opinion about things H
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,But the biggest deal where I thought it was an issue th where I heard things about it was H during the annual meeting right after when we had the discussion about the poster
BRAD,NA,Oh
PHIL,NA,H When we brought up the thing
BRAD,NA,Was Pat uh
PHIL,NA,Pat was right in the middle of it
BRAD,NA,See I I wasn't there
PHIL,NA,H and she was saying well this is a great piece and this is this H Well
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,you know I didn't wanna embarrass her
BRAD,NA,She shouldn't X have done that X
PHIL,NA,and I didn't wanna do anything
BRAD,NA,I know
PHIL,NA,But I just saw H people kinda going
BRAD,NA,That was out Yeah
PHIL,NA,You know
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,And H
BRAD,NA,That's true She shouldn't've been in on that X at all X>
BRAD,NA,She shouldn't've been you know cause that's not part of her capacity she's not on that committee
BRAD,NA,Mhm Mhm
PHIL,NA,you know and if she wants H you know basically the thing is you know if she wanted to be a board person
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,That's fine I mean let's look into b pursuing that
BRAD,NA,Right Right
PHIL,NA,H But see I'm afraid we're gonna lose Jim because of that he feels there's a conflict And uh it's definitely gonna happen
BRAD,NA,H I mean he says There's no question about it we've talked
PHIL,NA,Yeah and maybe it's right Maybe it s it is gonna be right
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,You know
BRAD,NA,H Well he d I mean he doesn't seem to you've talked to him and I've talked to him and
PHIL,NA,H Well he seems to be
BRAD,NA,I mean he says mayb you know after the board retreat now
PHIL,NA,Yeah
BRAD,NA,But not
PHIL,NA,H Well I a
BRAD,NA,X you know X
PHIL,NA,I wanted him I said I want you to stay through the board retreat
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,I says and the reason is because I said we need people who know H I said right now we have You know four new board members Or five
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,You know
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,Four whatever
BRAD,NA,Four new board yeah
PHIL,NA,H And we're at this point of saying okay Uh H Hx All of a sudden H we have t all these you know questions to answer
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,You know we have all these things that we have to do
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,and we have H this commitment of time Uh and but they don't know everything that's gone on in the last years
BRAD,NA,They need to be educated as to
PHIL,NA,H See this
BRAD,NA,no no
PHIL,NA,this retreat that's why you see I think it's important Because I mean I realized that I'd never seen the bylaws since I was on the board until I asked for a copy
BRAD,NA,Mhm Mhm Right Yeah H Now what I what I have done though is to you know any new board member that jumps on I send them
PHIL,NA,Good
BRAD,NA,copies of the
PHIL,NA,H because I wanna
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,I wanna get these books
BRAD,NA,but ty typically they no one reads em
PHIL,NA,H Well that's fine
BRAD,NA,H You know But it's At least they've got
PHIL,NA,But I think what I wanna do is I'm gonna I wanna draft a letter
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,Like I said which
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA, says to them you know this is what we're doing this is the purpose of this retreat
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,H To new board members and you know board members for a while it was we need to find out what it is we're doing
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,Whether we're doing something right or not You know
BRAD,NA,Right
PHIL,NA,H
BRAD,NA,Right
PHIL,NA,I think we are B but
BRAD,NA,Oh yeah Sure we are
PHIL,NA,I think H
BRAD,NA,Sure we are
PHIL,NA,the thing is I don't I need to b them to kind of commit To to being responsible
BRAD,NA,Mhm Yeah
PHIL,NA,And uh H I mean I kinda hate to feel like I'm taking charge but th I guess that's what I'm I'm needing to do
BRAD,NA,Well yeah for
PHIL,NA,You know but
BRAD,NA,y y you do and you're
PHIL,NA,H and that's kind of why I'm
BRAD,NA,and you're present
PHIL,NA,I'm going to assign things
BRAD,NA,Unhunh
PHIL,NA,you know at some point we're gonna have committees and we're gonna have H you know
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,b people that'll be given tasks
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,You know Specifically
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,H Like you know I didn't need to do all this calling aro to find a r a r retreat space but I figured if I don't do it
BRAD,NA,That's right
PHIL,NA,H it's gonna fall on you or pat
BRAD,NA,Yeah Of course Yeah
PHIL,NA,You know H
BRAD,NA,And normally that's that's what happens
PHIL,NA,That's okay but
BRAD,NA,I mean uh
PHIL,NA,You know I I'm a I'm a I'm aware of a lot of the things that are going on You know
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,I know that you're getting ready to leave and Pat's doing things so TSK H I'd better let you go get her
BRAD,NA,Yeah I know Okay
PHIL,NA,And we'll continue this
BRAD,NA,Well yeah There
PHIL,NA,In some manner but we don't have to talk about it at lunch if you don't want But I think
BRAD,NA,No that's fine
PHIL,NA,if we can H
BRAD,NA,That's fine
PHIL,NA,If we can go ahead and carry on
BRAD,NA,Um
PHIL,NA,at some point you and I I think
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,H Because
BRAD,NA,One thing that comes to mind is is the H well the question of meeting quarterly is that enough Meaning having H you know the
PHIL,NA,It would be enough if committees were to meet
BRAD,NA,uh If committees yeah and that's the
PHIL,NA,but
BRAD,NA,that that's that was Paul's uh desire
PHIL,NA,H TSK And I think
BRAD,NA,was uh
PHIL,NA,that's what we wanna talk ab
BRAD,NA,THROAT
PHIL,NA,we'll talk about that there too And say look
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,you know is quarterly H you know we would we need to meet every other month
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,You know do we need t do we need to meet you know H
BRAD,NA,as a full board every oth H w We shouldn't have to
PHIL,NA,We shouldn't
BRAD,NA,If the committees uh
PHIL,NA,H but these committees need to be active
BRAD,NA,function properly
PHIL,NA,and to X do their things X H
BRAD,NA,Right
PHIL,NA,Basically you know the publications committee needs to be more involved than just making decisions on what we publish H
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,You know
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,They need to become somewhat self-sufficient Collections committee
BRAD,NA,
PHIL,NA,needs you know I would like to create collections committee to be something where we're almost matching
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,Funds they can raise maybe
PHIL,NA,Unhunh Yeah
PHIL,NA,You know If they can raise ten grand
BRAD,NA,Well H
PHIL,NA,you know
BRAD,NA,and have some
PHIL,NA,I mean realistically
BRAD,NA,have some incentive
PHIL,NA,H Right
BRAD,NA,For them to yeah
PHIL,NA,So that basically they'd be they'd get to a point of saying
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,Okay we need to be responsible X with X this so that collections
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,and publications will be all fund raising too
BRAD,NA,Right
PHIL,NA,H
BRAD,NA,Oh boy Phil that's
PHIL,NA,Yeah it's not gonna be pretty
BRAD,NA,Yeah that's where
PHIL,NA,Because that's Hx
BRAD,NA,You know also we may consider you know we have one board opening And I we may think about Gail
PHIL,NA,H Well Gail is very interested and so is this we met with another person by the name of Bill Ashby
BRAD,NA,Hm Yeah X I know X
PHIL,NA,H Jack and I and Jim met with him
BRAD,NA,Oh you mean his Jack's financial friend that
PHIL,NA,Jack's friend
BRAD,NA,is retired
PHIL,NA,Yeah He's a banker
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,and he'd be good on one hand But
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,I would like H ideally XX I'd want em both
BRAD,NA,Yeah Yeah
BRAD,NA,You know And I'm hoping
BRAD,NA,H Yeah I
PHIL,NA,what I'm gonna what I'm anticipating doing is uh this retreat might urge people H to say I'm not interested in doing that much work
BRAD,NA,Yeah And so I'm getting yeah
PHIL,NA,H And it might just f get like Nancy and Kay I mean I like Kay XX
BRAD,NA,TSK H See Nancy was going off She she told me she was going off this year H And she uh
PHIL,NA,H
BRAD,NA,and Kay convinced said well Nancy you can't leave right away and uh H uh she said okay I'll stay another year But I don't know why
PHIL,NA,H
BRAD,NA,You know and and then we can why tha I think that's very important to discuss At the board retreat
PHIL,NA,TSK H I think it is because I mean the thing is that we need to get to a point and the reason we've set terms is because basically people here H
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,majority of us have been here a long time
BRAD,NA,TSK Yeah That's right
PHIL,NA,You know and there's a point
BRAD,NA,well that's why we have this the term limitation
PHIL,NA,Unhunh
BRAD,NA,XXX H
PHIL,NA,I'm I I'm uh full agreement cause I'm ready You know
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,H I've agreed to do this term
BRAD,NA,Yeah Mhm
PHIL,NA,but
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,my feeling is I'm ready for a year off
BRAD,NA,Yeah
PHIL,NA,H You know
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,and I'll still be volunteering but I really am ready for some time to say
BRAD,NA,Mhm
PHIL,NA,H You know and I wanted Jim to consider being market manager even if he goes off the board
BRAD,NA,Yeah H I know he was wavering a little bit on that whether or not he would volunteer at the marketing center
PHIL,NA,H Yeah I mean there's
BRAD,NA,I've gotta run now
PHIL,NA,Okay j See you Brad
BRAD,NA,Um but the lun uh
PHIL,NA,H We're gonna meet here
BRAD,NA,Oh you're gonna have x
PHIL,NA,so we can d- either swing by for you or we can decide we'll call you
BRAD,NA,Oh so X you're not X
PHIL,NA,when I know what we're doing if you want
BRAD,NA,Okay that'd be great Alright
PHIL,NA,XXX

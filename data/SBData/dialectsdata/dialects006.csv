LENORE,CA,H So
ALINA,CA,H
LENORE,CA,uh who's gonna take Hector's place
ALINA,CA,It Hx I don't know They'll have to see
LENORE,CA,They gonna bring in some neurotic from New Jersey
ALINA,CA,H
LENORE,CA,@
ALINA,CA,Yeah sounds like a good idea
LENORE,CA,H
ALINA,CA,Somebody that could sit there and take orders and listen to what they have to say and how they wanna do it Part of the problem with this whole thing was that uh how I see it H was that Ellen was not relinquishing t her duties to let Hector go ahead and run it Jake was feeling threatened sc because associate producer is supposed to run editorial H And b it makes sense Hector had an Emmy nomination I would let him run editorial I would let him do anything he wanted to do in editorial H They clipped his wings They wouldn't let him do anything There are three shows in trouble H He was not allowed to help on any of em None of em
LENORE,CA,That's changed now though he can be like he was before again
ALINA,CA,H Yeah
LENORE,CA,edit and the neurotics are out
ALINA,CA,Hx Well what's gonna happen that he is editorial Period Cause st Stevie's supposed to leave in February so unless they f they They have to look for an editor
LENORE,CA,Rosenblum's coming back though isn't he
ALINA,CA,TSK I don't know what he's gonna do He wants to work actually features He doesn't really wanna do TV
LENORE,CA,H
ALINA,CA,H SNIFF
LENORE,CA,Hm

LENORE,CA,
ALINA,CA,

ALINA,CA,H One of those places H It all means the same to me
LENORE,CA,H
ALINA,CA,H You know
LENORE,CA,really
ALINA,CA,I can never tell the difference H
LENORE,CA,MTM MGM Lorimar
ALINA,CA,Except one day
LENORE,CA,
ALINA,CA,Hector was s you know they were scoring the show last week And I and I called up to talk to him
LENORE,CA,H
ALINA,CA,and H I could hear the um the musicians in the background tuning up their instruments
LENORE,CA,Hx
ALINA,CA,H And then you know X and X it's okay to talk to Hector I could hear him a little bit but not too well but you know I still could talk to him and the next thing you hear all these horns blaring So he said Lina I have to go No shit
LENORE,CA,
ALINA,CA,H I can't hear you at all
LENORE,CA,H
ALINA,CA,sweetheart H Call me when I can hear you H It was funny H That's the only part I'll miss
LENORE,CA,So X X
ALINA,CA,but X Hx
LENORE,CA,His position is pretty uh
ALINA,CA,TSK H stable Yeah Fletcher Well see actually Fletcher was going to ask Hector to move back to editorial but he didn't know how to approach him cause he thought he was so thrilled about being associate producer But Hector really hated it H So Hector's the one H when was it Two weekend Two weekends ago Or last weekend He c he said He looked at me and he goes Q p_so Lina what happens on Hanukkah Hx Q And I was going H I can't exactly remember the story but all I know is you light a candle and open a present And he goes so if I call Fletcher it wouldn't be any great shakes and I said nope
LENORE,CA,SWALLOW
ALINA,CA,H X I said what X h he di never told me why he was calling up Fletcher so um Sunday he looked at me and he goes H I'm calling Fletcher I want to go back to editorial I said Q okay go ahead Q H So he called Fletcher and Fletcher was so relieved Cause he wanted to ask Hector to move back to editorial He's just happy he did it
LENORE,CA,Why did he want to ask Hector to move back to editorial
ALINA,CA,H Because he's so unhappy with the editorial staff That they couldn't get what they wanted out of Sherry
LENORE,CA,Hx
ALINA,CA,and they couldn't get what it they wanted out of Seppie H It's actually not Seppie's fault it's kind of they needed to work with him more but that Sherry was impossible H Hx She was a witch TSK And then her assistant pulled stunts where she didn't H do stuff that everybody knows assistants do which I wouldn't know but cause I'm X no X assistant H But things like making sure that the script gets to the people doing the sound effects so that they can follow along and make certain that their sound effects are going in the right spots that kind of thing H She totally screwed up the the show that they're working on now I don't know what number that is Hx Sylvia
LENORE,CA,What show is being shown now
ALINA,CA,H Well it's the one they're working on v the one they're working on's not always the one that's being shown
LENORE,CA,No But what one is tonight
ALINA,CA,Tonight I don't know
LENORE,CA,Four Five
ALINA,CA,H
LENORE,CA,Six
ALINA,CA,This i I don't know We'll have to ch Oh this is the second one in the new season
LENORE,CA,Hm
ALINA,CA,but I don't know H if this was really number two
LENORE,CA,Hm
ALINA,CA,how they placed it or if it was like like you said number three four or five H Because they had such a b hard time with it Like last week's wasn't supposed to be shown even though it was supposed to be number one because it was so poorly done It had so much wrong with it H Hector kept trying to get it corrected like a month ago And they kept stopping him stopping stopping stopping stopping
LENORE,CA,TSK Cause of her
ALINA,CA,TSK Cause of her cause of Jake Nixon He didn't want him to do it H And it makes him look like an idiot cause he's the director and you can tell where he's missed the shots H Has nothing whatsoever to do with anybody else It's Jake But he'll s He'd cut off his nose to spite his face That's stupid H So now Fletcher's starting to realize what's going on H It's hard because the hatchet man actually in the group is Ed Ed's the one that'll come in TSK and he'll go ahead and say H this is what needs to be done Okay and h or he'll look at you and he'll go Q that was a stupid thing to do why'd you do that Q You know makes the editor really stop and think Or makes whoever it is stop and think the director H But Fletcher'll kind of sit there and kind of go VOX well mhm Well let me see that that seemed to be okay but I'll have to think about it VOX He's real wishy-washy H SNIFF He's too uh namby pamby You need somebody to come in and go POW POW POW
LENORE,CA,Yeah
ALINA,CA,H t_So they're kind of suffering that Hx from that this year Not having that on there But Fletcher's having to learn how to be more assertive Otherwise his show's just gonna go down the tubes
LENORE,CA,Yeah
ALINA,CA,H And they can't afford that right now

ROY,NA,Bill McKibben
MARILYN,CA,twenty-eight-year-old Harvard guy

PETE,CA,Right
MARILYN,CA,All the natural world was gone in nineteen seventy-five
ROY,NA,His premise is basically this
MARILYN,CA,and now XXX
ROY,NA,That um as soon as the world hit a point where there was no more objectively pristine land
PETE,CA,Unhunh
ROY,NA,When you know they found pollution on top of Mount Everest
PETE,CA,Right mhm
ROY,NA,and at the very bottom of the ocean
PETE,CA,Right
ROY,NA,FOOD Well that's it FOOD
PETE,CA,Mhm
ROY,NA,Man has had some effect On the entire absolute absoluteness of the globe
PETE,CA,Right
ROY,NA,So in principle the concept of nature as a system inside of which man lives is over
PETE,CA,Mhm Right
ROY,NA,And then in practice since then which was fifteen years ago
PETE,CA,mhm
ROY,NA,MRC man has had such MRC dramatic impact on what we used to think of as nature H that Hx that the only way to coexist with nature It's no longer nature the quasi religious overarching ordering principle
PETE,CA,Right
ROY,NA,inside of which mankind lives
MARILYN,CA,Wordsworthian nature
PETE,CA,Mhm
ROY,NA,and uh you know w a a thing that we can all rely on as a balancing force over and above ourselves to order the universe Forget all that
PETE,CA,Mhm
MARILYN,CA,Woo that's spicy
ROY,NA,It's now
MARILYN,CA,Shit THROAT
ROY,NA,you know the world is gonna be kept in order by the same people that brought you
MARILYN,CA,COUGH COUGH COUGH
ROY,NA,you know
MARILYN,CA,COUGH
ROY,NA,the atomic bomb
PETE,CA,Right
MARILYN,CA,H
ROY,NA,and
MARILYN,CA,COUGH COUGH
ROY,NA,all that stuff Right
PETE,CA,Right
ROY,NA,Which just doesn't sound like a very practical proposal
PETE,CA,Yeah
MARILYN,CA,Wow
ROY,NA,You know the same people brought you the extinction of all the large mammals in Europe and America
PETE,CA,X
MARILYN,CA,And the dodo
ROY,NA,are now entrusted with
PETE,CA,maintaining what's there
ROY,NA,XX
MARILYN,CA,The rest of the natural world
ROY,NA,maintaining the entire globe for the rest of time
PETE,CA,mhm Right
ROY,NA,Not likely
MARILYN,CA,Mhm
ROY,NA,So that was his basic premise And then he goes on for the rest of book to absolutely
MARILYN,CA,Then X it X gets really depressing
ROY,NA,heartlessly
PETE,CA,@Oh @good
MARILYN,CA,@ @@@@ 
PETE,CA, oh gee  COMMA OR PERIOD
ROY,NA,heartlessly debunk
MARILYN,CA,You haven't heard nothing yet

PETE,CA,X Right X
MARILYN,CA,And I It was really I read the whole thing which is pretty rare Well my my
ROY,NA,So I mean but his premise is not that mankind can't survive on Earth
PETE,CA,Right
ROY,NA,His question is
MARILYN,CA,X It's just X it's a whole different earth
ROY,NA,can mankind spiritually survive
PETE,CA,Right
ROY,NA,H in a metaphysical world in which it is patently obvious that man is the highest active principle
PETE,CA,Mhm
ROY,NA,You know Outside of completely faith-based belief in God you know which is irrespective of any relationship to nature
PETE,CA,Mhm
ROY,NA,there is now absolutely nothing in the world to which we are beholden And he w his question was what impact is this gonna have on the
MARILYN,CA,Sort of fucks up the animists
ROY,NA,cultural growth
MARILYN,CA,
PETE,CA,Right
ROY,NA,of of the human species
MARILYN,CA,Mhm

MARILYN,CA,Unhunh
PETE,CA,On the other hand isn't he saying its too late
ROY,NA,Well he is kind of saying its too late
PETE,CA,So
ROY,NA,This is why its such a depressing book
PETE,CA,right
ROY,NA,He's saying we already did it and we haven't even thought about
MARILYN,CA,So much for culture
ROY,NA,whether we wanted to do it or not
MARILYN,CA,@
PETE,CA,Right
MARILYN,CA,This is typical
PETE,CA,Yeah You know

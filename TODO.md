# Outline of Project

## Current Steps

1. Research language profiles of U.S. to split into sectors (smaller the better).
    - Done! Instead of regions, split into non-overlapping areas (states) with words being able to have multiple "origins".

2. Create database of classed "buzzwords" (draw from data.gov, NLTK, etc.).
    - In progress. Current corpus is from the Dictionary of American Regional English, over 4000 entries (words only).

3. Build a Naive Bayes classifier to assign probabilities to geographic origin based on a collection (sentence) of words.

4. Derive geographic area of a single word

6. Predict origin of speaker through a number of questions.

7. Predict location of speaker through transcribed speech or writing.


## Future Steps?
7. Plot the popularity of specific words on map.

8. Use machine learning to potentially improve feedback.
    - Will be doing this anyway (Naive Bayes, NLTK, sklearn-pipeline)

9. Expand to other English-speaking countries.

10. Expand to other languages.

# Outline of Project

## Current Steps (updated 2/25/2018)

- Research language profiles of U.S. to split into sectors (smaller the better).
    - Done.

- Create database of classed "buzzwords" (draw from data.gov, NLTK, etc.).
    - Done.

- Build a Naive Bayes classifier to assign probabilities to geographic origin based on a collection (sentence) of words.
    - Done.

- Derive geographic area of a single word
    - Done.

- Predict location of speaker through transcribed speech or writing.
    - Done.

## Future Steps
- Plot the popularity of specific words on map.

- Use machine learning to improve feedback.
    - balance training datasets with more information from less popular states
    - utilize other ML techniques in the future

- Expand to other English-speaking countries.

- Expand to other languages.

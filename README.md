Correlating language to author's geographic origin in Python.


## Project Objective

By using principles from the field of linguistics, a trained ear or eye can often
profile where a speaker/writer hails from based on the certain terminologies they
use. Each of these "buzzwords" can be traced to a geographic area, varying in size,
and the overlaps between these regions can point to the origin of the speaker.


This project aims to automate the above process. It will contain a number of
functions to classify language into its geographic origin within the United States.

MONTOYA,NA,What else Politics deals with the question of power right That's the introduction to empowerment What is power Very quickly come on all of you should know these two concepts they're not that difficult What is power What are we talking about
FRANK,CA,Having the capacity to impact public policy
MONTOYA,NA,Alright H So if we're talking about politics politics is tied into the whole concept of power right And if we're talking about empowerment as a concept H we must have an understanding of the notion of what is power H Now does power come in one form does it come in many different forms
MARIA,NA,Different
MONTOYA,NA,Different forms Back here What forms Give me examples of power Either one of you
RUBEN,CA,
LAURA,CA,
RUBEN,CA,H Education knowledge
MONTOYA,NA,Alright knowledge
RUBEN,CA,knowledge
MONTOYA,NA,Okay what else
LAURA U,NA, X WH Money WH
LAURA,CA,um your position in the workforce Um
MONTOYA,NA,Okay
LAURA,CA,X I'm trying to think of the word X
MONTOYA,NA,Alright Close Right
RAMON,CA,Wealth numbers
MONTOYA,NA,Wealth
RAMON,CA,numbers of people
MONTOYA,NA,Numbers of people right What else
FRANK,CA,Social status
MONTOYA,NA,Social status position right H If you're the chairperson of um a major corporation would you say that that person has some power
FRANK,CA,Most definitely
MONTOYA,NA,Alright Especially if you're X in uh X IBM or General Motors or Chrysler Corporation and
RAMON,CA,I think in some some t some examples some gender and race can give you power
MONTOYA,NA,Gender race alright
RAMON,CA,Gender
MONTOYA,NA,Let's deal with that Alright Gender race Let's talk about H race in terms of power If I make the statement which I did that there's no fear factor when it comes to the Chicano_Latino community H and there is much more of a fear factor in dealing with the African_American community H am I not dealing with a racial factor of power
RAMON,CA,WH Yes WH
FRANK,CA,Sure
MONTOYA,NA,Why
FRANK,CA,Because it's gonna affect the decision making process the politics X and um the policy X
MONTOYA,NA,Alright
RAMON,CA,Africa In um i Kinda like in past African_Americans have been more organized and have had more leaders H or not more leaders but who have more leaders who've been known or something
MONTOYA,NA,More recognized
RAMON,CA,like Martin Luther King
MONTOYA,NA,That's right
RAMON,CA,Yeah more recognized and
MONTOYA,NA,Alright
RAMON,CA,I think that's a fear factor XX
MONTOYA,NA,That is a part of the fear factor
RAMON,CA,Mhm
MONTOYA,NA,H I mean uh if one looks at what uh Jesse Jackson is doing vis a vis H who The major league Baseball teams and all that Football and all that H What's his underlying argument What's his criticism That there're not sufficient numbers of what
FRANK,CA,Blacks
MONTOYA,NA,Well he says minorities He's smart He's talks about minorities But he's really talking about African_Americans
FRANK,CA,In the uh managerial process of
MONTOYA,NA,Right
FRANK,CA,of professional sports
MONTOYA,NA,Exactly Managerial owners managers et cetera right Alright Hx Have you heard X of a Latino X say this Or would a XXX Jesse Jackson have said that about Latinos Hm No X Unh_unh X We haven't And uh we're gonna get into that in our discussion Alright H So the whole notion of power is very important to understand because here I am making some statements Alright Some generalities that some people would say are not true I mean how can H Doctor Montoya say that Latinos have no no real power no fear factor After all H they have two people that are cabinet members they have H supervisor here in Los Angeles they have city council people in Los Angeles and yet he's saying that they have no power H Well power is relative as well right It's relative It's relational Power is relational How can you measure power Power is impossible to measure Alright In other words you cannot break power apart into vi H various ingredients and say A B C D these are the ingredients of power H We can make generalities Position Wealth All these different things that I've talked about H But power is difficult to measure So that we must deal with the whole question of empowerment from also the perspective of potential power H versus actual power There is a difference If I am for example the president H of a major labor union or a major corporation the position H as president of that entity gives me so much power But yet if I do not know how to utilize that entity in terms of its mobilization H for a given objective like a labor union If I have fourteen million people as members H and I don't show any manifestation of power am I powerful Well it has to be measured by what you're trying to do what the objectives are Example Labor today is being challenged by perhaps one of the most serious pieces of not legislation per se because it's not in a legislative form yet H but a proposed North American Free Trade Agreement that if passed by Congress is going to impact three economies Canada U.S and Mexico H Labor as a sector is going to be the most impacted How is labor today mobilizing its great power Uh not just the AFL_CIO and its fourteen million members H but the United Auto Workers and many other or labor organizations what are they doing to influence public policy
FRANK,CA,Combining power
MONTOYA,NA,Huh
FRANK,CA,They're combining their power
MONTOYA,NA,How are they combining their power
FRANK,CA,By al allying with other um TSK unions X of workers X
MONTOYA,NA,Alright they're they're they're forming coalitions among themselves they're forming coalitions with who Environmental groups right Cause environment supposedly is going to be also negatively impacted especially along the border Alright so there's there's a lot of coalition building But can you say as a historian that labor is doing what they were infamous for doing thirty forty years ago Taking to the streets
FRANK,CA,No No they've definitely lost power
MONTOYA,NA,Alright good point They have He said they have lost power H So your measurement of a loss of power is based on what
FRANK,CA,What they can and can't XXX
MONTOYA,NA,Alright Alright You don't see what you've read about right
FRANK,CA,Right
MONTO,CA,A today Alright That's one perception Is the Black community less powerful today in nineteen_ninety_three than it was H in nineteen sixty eight with the poor people's march on Washington H or nineteen_sixty_three again on the w uh march uh to Washington on Washington when Martin Luther King gave his H famous speech I have a dream There were three hundred thousand people at that march in nineteen_sixty_three Which period of time historically speaking H was a time where Blacks were manifesting much more power Today or nineteen_sixty_three or nineteen_sixty_eight When RACHEL X When they m X manifest they're beginning to get more power
MONTO,CA,A When uh in in comp in in RACHEL Now
MONTO,CA,A When do uh X make X a comparison nineteen_ninety_three H nineteen_sixty_eight nineteen_sixty_three during those three periods when would you say Blacks demonstrated much more power RACHEL Now They have more power now
MONTO,CA,A They have more power Why do you say that RACHEL Cause they're more recognized X I mean X
MONTOYA,NA,H Does recognition give you power Hm X P Yeah P
FRANK,CA,To a To some aspects yeah I think I think the the problem with your question is s a different sort of powers
MONTOYA,NA,Ah Very good Explain that
FRANK,CA,You have uh you have African_Americans more institutionalized in our system now
MONTOYA,NA,X Ah X
FRANK,CA,than they were in sixty_eight
MONTOYA,NA,Alright Stop right there Today they have how many Congressmen Thirty eight Thirty eight congressional representatives I don't know how many they had in nineteen_sixty_three I'm not even gonna try to guess but uh probably H no more than two or three if they were lucky Alright Would you say that
FRANK,CA,X I would say that's right X
MONTOYA,NA,Alright Go on What else
FRANK,CA,In sixty_eight the Blacks were a whole lot more mobile mobilized Much better mobilized three_hundred_thousand marching on Washington is an example You probably couldn't get that today
MONTOYA,NA,Okay Alright
RAMON,CA,COUGH
MONTOYA,NA,X You know with X>Chicanos the highpoint of the mobilization capability was nineteen_seventy During the era of the Vietnam War Twenty_five_thousand Chicanos were mobilized in Los Angeles a at the national Chicano moratorium against the war No one has come even close With the exception of the death of Cesar Chavez recently H where there were approximately forty_thousand people to mobilize large numbers of people into some kind of a effort or movement Alright H So he's correct It depends on the time depends on the circumstances H and the form of power H Institutionalized power is different from the unconventional form that uh y you just described Alright H Well what we're trying to get at is potential versus actual My argument as humble as it is is that Chicanos in nineteen_ninety_three are fast developing a high potential for power but they're a long way from actualizing their true power Okay In other words they're we're still at the potential phase of our empowerment and not at the actual power phase Alright Anything else On those two concepts Alright Let's get into discussion on voter participation and these are kind of general comments I don't have the time to give you a lot of statistics but I'll give you some general uh trends some statistical information H that will prove a point H that will introduce the subject of political participation H in the United States Now a democracy the participation of the citizenry is imperative It is absolutely imperative if it's to be a democracy to have the people participate H Now what am I trying to say What am I trying to say It is imperative for the people to participate in the political process Another way of saying it What am I saying
CAROLYN,CA,We have to vote X everyone X
MONTOYA,NA,But why is it important in a democracy for the people to participate Just deal with the question Not the methods
CAROLYN,CA,X You mean X because if the people don't vote it will be there will be an elite group it'll be more of a monarchy that has control it won't be a democracy
MONTOYA,NA,Okay what's a monarchy
RUBEN,CA,Kings
FRANK,CA,One ruler
CAROLYN,CA,Well one
RUBEN,CA,Royalty
MONTOYA,NA,What
FRANK,CA,One ruler
RUBEN,CA,Royalty or one family
CAROLYN,CA,XXXX
MONTOYA,NA,Alright Close There's a royal type of family right king
CAROLYN,CA,Yeah
MONTOYA,NA,not elected alright hereditary et cetera et cetera alright But what am I getting at W what's the essence of what I'm asking for Yes Fire away
RUBEN,CA,By its very nature democracy demands voting Without voting XX
MONTOYA,NA,Ah Stop right there You made a statement By the very nature of democracy H What is a democracy
RUBEN,CA,Democracy is rule by the people
MONTOYA,NA,Alright H L Demos cratos L right People rule
RUBEN,CA,XX
MONTO,CA,A Another Greek word The Greeks were major contributors to this political process of development of concepts L Demos cratos L People govern or people rule Alright We tell the world that democracy is what we practice Is that correct Is that what we tell the world MANY Yeah
MONTOYA,NA,Yes Alright Would you agree X with that X Okay What else do we say selling our political system H In selling our political system we make it synonymous synonymous by saying that we don't distinguish the form of economic system versus the political system H and that we put it in the same kettle H Democracy and capitalism are essentially the same Are they the same
FRANK,CA,No
MONTO,CA,A No But yet we do H And if we listen carefully and read carefully all these books on international relations foreign relations and so forth what is it that we tell the world that America is The cradle of democracy We are the cradle of democracy H we are the bastion of the free world et cetera et cetera et cetera And when H Ronald Reagan was in power we talked about the evil empire right H Categorizing uh the Soviet Union and the so_called Communist empire as a evil empire Alright I say this because H there is a tendency for some of us to believe because we have been conditioned right Who conditions us to think the way we think What did we deci What did we say earlier talking about culture RACHEL Um they learn through schools X through their families X
MONTOYA,NA,Schools right Schools The media Everything else H I mean doesn't the media tell us that there's only a two_party system in this country
FRANK M,NA,m
FRANK,CA,Mhm Why is it that the Communist Party the Socialist Workers Party the Prohibitionist Party the American Independent Party H all these parties that we have supposedly minority parties don't get the same kind of treatment as the Democratic and Republican parties They're not mainstream right We have a two-party system H We are taught from the very beginning that there's only two parties That's a l different subject But I'm What I'm The point I'm trying to make is that if we look into the realities of what we have as a political system we tell the world that in this country democracy is very much alive because we have a congress we have H a supreme court we have a presidency H we have a political system that is governed by certain principles and laws H that emanate from what The Constitution which is a living document The Constitution right H That is very much the document that protects H conceptually and otherwise our way of life Our democracy and so forth Well if we remember our Chicano history my point as we get into the whole question of Chicano political participation is that H it's difficult for us as Chicanos as we get into it to understand why is it including ourselves because a lot of Chicanos don't even understand why we don't vote why don't we participate and they come up with all kinds of H somewhat superficial analysis that much of our political behavior is a product of what was covered in this class under history H and culture and what did I say Two major currents of history two major currents of political culture right And what is political culture I'll get back to that concept But just general terms What is political culture What is political culture Alright I want you to think Put that concept down because you're gonna you're gonna hear about it in the next few minutes It's very important that you understand that concept Political culture H But I want Thing I want to underline here is that we are products H of a historical dualistic process Mexico's history US history H we're a pr we're products of what A cultural process that's also Mexican and American Whatever American means Alright So those two major ingredients H have molded the rationale that I'm using in this class to explain why is it that we're still at the potential phase of empowerment and we still have a long ways to go before we realize that concept that I describe called empowerment H But before we get into that s substance of that H is that I wanna just briefly cover that even though I'm saying that Chicanos do not vote in great numbers And we don't participate in many organizations in great numbers H The fact is as I mentioned earlier that even though we tell the world we are this beacon of light of freedom of liberty justice and all these different things H by and large not a lot of people participate politically across the board I don't care if you're African-American I don't care if you're Asian-American and I don't care if you're Latino or whatever Most Americans do not vote in great numbers So it's a double whammy Introducing the subject matter here Americans in comparison to Great Britain in comparison to France H in comparison to Germany in comparison to Italy we don't vote in the numbers that they do Alright I mean if we had more time I could give you statistic after statistic H Italy for example has a voter turnout of ninety percent Of those that are eligible to vote we're lucky if we get fifty percent Are we less democratic Are they more democratic Why is it that Italy has H a much larger a higher voter level of participation Or Germany Or even Canada Seventy percent The fact is that democracy in this country is dying I want you to put that down Cause it's gonna be important At least for my analysis I don't want you to agree or disagree at this point just write it down H you have plenty of time One week to think about it American democracy is dying I want you to put that whole phrase in black and white H American democracy is dying and I want you to try to think of why As we get into the discussion of Chicano participation And we'll get back to that statement next week So for us as Chicanos it's a double jeopardy That's another point I wanna underscore Because if the larger general population doesn't vote in great numbers H when you're at the bottom of a political socioeconomic totem pole and you're at the bottom you're at the very bottom with all the problems of poverty and all the social problems that we're H we've been talking about it's understandable why perhaps Chicanos do not vote or participate in great numbers H Now the literature in political science dealing with factors influence influencing voting are many Are many Civic Culture Almond and Verba nineteen-seventy-two or so is one book that you can look at um there's a book by Raymond Wolfinger Steven Ronsteen Ronstone I'm sorry H Who Votes that's another book X Okay X the literature goes on and on But all I want to do in terms of just giving you some idea of what are the factors that influence peoples participation in the political process of this country H And there are essentially five You can probably develop more but these are general categories Most of the literature in political science and I think Mister Verba would agree with me on this H that people tend to vote because they have a sense of duty What does that mean A sense of duty They regard participation as important Now why would you say that this is a factor that influences voting Now this is a very somewhat altruistic uh value right A sense of duty Why Why would you say that people in this country have a Some people that vote X COUGH COUGH
MONTOYA,NA,vote because they have a sense of duty Why Right here
BEV,CA,I don't know probably it stems mostly from your education your childhood when your told you're an American citizen and it's your civic duty you know H towards other people and you know getting the government going to vote and put your two cents in Because without you then y we won't have government Same sense of jury duty too X Jury
MONTOYA,NA,Okay Good point
BEV,CA,duty X
MONTOYA,NA,As we go through some of these these five I want you to think of the agents of socialization Because then I want you to think when we get into the discussion on Chicanos how do those agents affect us as Chicanos Alright number one sense of duty Who is responsible for inculcating that sense of duty One the family Alright Remember The family is your primary agent Two the educational institutions I mean from the time that you start kindergarten to the time that you graduate from the university H it's constant not constant but somewhat of a consistent bombardment of values attitudes et cetera reinforcing the nature of the political system and the virtues of participating in the political process H So in essence what I'm saying is you acquire this through the socialization process that we've discussed already Yes
RUBEN,CA,I think that it's more eye-opening to see that this doesn't exist more than it does And that's why people don't vote H It seems that I mean you talk to people H they have an attitude I can't make a difference That's why I don't vote It's not my responsibility That's why I don't vote There's not a sense of duty Even though like you said from the beginning supposedly we're getting it all through school
MONTOYA,NA,Why do you suppose that has changed And this is a much of a recent phenomena much more H Because you've had H declining voter participation levels since the nineteen-seventies And I'm giving you the answer Wa what what what has been the problem Contributing to what you just said
RAMON,CA,Well I agree I agree with what he was saying but I think m maybe one of the reasons could be they're not being represented they don't think they're being represented they don't um see any like direct results for them you know coming out of like
MONTOYA,NA,Mhm
RAMON,CA,the representation the government and who's in control
MONTOYA,NA,Okay
RAMON,CA,I think I I n
MONTOYA,NA,<X That's
RAMON,CA,You know there are a lot of people
MONTOYA,NA,Sure X> alright
RAMON,CA,<X I mean X>
MONTOYA,NA,That's Would you agree with that
RAMON,CA,A lot of people
MARIA,NA,Mhm
RAMON,CA,they vote their pocketbook
MARIA,NA,Sure
RAMON,CA,They They're P They vote their pocketbook P
MONTOYA,NA,They vote definitely their pocketbook Alright That's true What would you add to f
RAMON,CA,Hx
MARIA,NA,Well you say we're not represented it's like we say there's not much choice between say like the last um you know X you X voted for Clinton or you know you know whatever his name was X X
MARIA,NA,
MONTOYA,NA,Bush
MARIA,NA,
GILBERT,CA,XX
MARIA,NA,Yeah
MONTOYA,NA,Bush in a bush X @@
GILBERT,CA,X
MARIA,NA,No
GILBERT,CA,I don't think
MARIA,NA,the other guy
GILBERT,CA,I don't think there's as much trust
MONTOYA,NA,Oh Perot
GILBERT,CA,XX
MONTOYA,NA,Trust
GILBERT,CA,Trust in the system
MONTOYA,NA,Why
GILBERT,CA,A lot more corruption <X I mean X> you had Nixon
MONTOYA,NA,Why
GILBERT,CA,H to Watergate
MONTOYA,NA,What did you have in the seventies Now l let's talk about that What what did What did What did we have
GILBERT,CA,Okay
MONTOYA,NA,X You X
GILBERT,CA,Well in the beginning well even in the late sixties you had Vietnam you had uh
MONTOYA,NA,Good Excellent H What did Vietnam do
GILBERT,CA,Turned uh the youth especially against the government policies the educated youth More so H and those were I think the people that were gonna be voting as they went on They lost faith in the system They lost faith in their leaders
MONTOYA,NA,"Alright Alright On that score would you say that most of you, without getting personal here are products uh in terms of birth of the sixties All of you were born in the sixties Early seventies Right So that means that most of your parents X THROAT"
MONTOYA,NA,were very much a part of the era of the sixties right Alright Would you say go back to you that your parents were very much influenced by the Vietnam war One way or the other
GILBERT,CA,Yeah
MONTOYA,NA,Which Which way Which direction
GILBERT,CA,Um total apathy
MONTOYA,NA,Total apathy
GILBERT,CA,Yeah
MONTOYA,NA,Why
GILBERT,CA,Um well my mom Total apathy Uh She just I th I don't know I think she just got burned out She got sick and tired of you know turning on the news and seeing another corrupt man or another you know another scandal breaking out She knew friends that were dying in Viet you know She had friends that were drafted XX were sent were dying and she didn't you know she didn't believe in the system and she just didn't care anymore I think it was just a lot of negatives had built up
MONTOYA,NA,Okay
GILBERT,CA,and she just let it go
MONTOYA,NA,Okay how about you How about your parents
CAROLYN,CA,Um well my dad was drafted
MONTOYA,NA,He was in Vietnam
CAROLYN,CA,Um long story he didn't make it to Vietnam but um H
MONTOYA,NA,But he was in the military during that time
CAROLYN,CA,He was in the military at the time
MONTOYA,NA,Alright
CAROLYN,CA,yeah
MONTOYA,NA,Okay
CAROLYN,CA,My mom claims she was too young to know but H I don't know
MONTOYA,NA,Okay
CAROLYN,CA,Um I don't know how my dad really felt about it I know we come from a long line of military men so he kind of felt a sense of duty so um
MONTOYA,NA,Was there a sense of betrayal
CAROLYN,CA,Possibly yeah
MONTOYA,NA,Mhm
CAROLYN,CA,X

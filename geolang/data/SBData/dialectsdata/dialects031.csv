BETH,NA,Yeah That's true X And she'd X bad back and she's always always using nose spray
SHERRY,NA,Hx H Maybe she's
BETH,NA,Alw
ROSEMARY,NA,H Maybe she's addicted
SHERRY,NA, a semi-@hypochondriac
ROSEMARY,NA,H Maybe there's coke in it

ROSEMARY,NA,Sherry Yeah
BETH,NA,Yeah I think you're right
SHERRY,NA,Oh Oh
ROSEMARY,NA,H COUGH COUGH COUGH
SHERRY,NA,SNIFF I always have get backaches
BETH,NA,Cause she goes to the doctor a lot
SHERRY,NA,But
BETH,NA,It seems to me
SHERRY,NA,Oh really I think I get backaches because I mean some people's bodies are built a certain way
BETH,NA,Well bad posture and just don't take care of it
SHERRY,NA,Well yeah I'm sure that's part of it
BETH,NA,You know
ROSEMARY,NA,And also because of the way you sit
SHERRY,NA,No but I mean some people get backaches more than other people
ROSEMARY,NA,H and because
SHERRY,NA,H
ROSEMARY,NA,you're tall H and the world is built for women who are about five five
SHERRY,NA,It's And it's
BETH,NA,And because you're The body is not
SHERRY,NA,H It's cause of the way my body is
BETH,NA,the human body H No But Doctor Hensel told me that everybody gets backaches
SHERRY,NA,Yeah
BETH,NA,Because y H The human bod backbone
SHERRY,NA,Oh
BETH,NA,not the body but the backbone
SHERRY,NA,Right
BETH,NA,is not built
SHERRY,NA,Right
BETH,NA,for an animal to walk on two feet
SHERRY,NA,Oh I see
BETH,NA,it's built for an animal to walk on all fours
SHERRY,NA,Right Right
BETH,NA,So if you were spent your whole life on your hands and knees you never get a backache That's basically
ROSEMARY,NA,TSK H Actually that helps when you have a backache
SHERRY,NA,Hm Really
ROSEMARY,NA,Is to get down on your hands and knees and walk arou and crawl around
BETH,NA,Mm
SHERRY,NA,Oh not crou Not all the way down though Hunh
ROSEMARY,NA,Hm-m
SHERRY,NA,It hurt but then your back's gets sway back
BETH,NA,No but
ROSEMARY,NA,TSK N but th
BETH,NA,No if you But if you're moving it won't If you just stand there it will
SHERRY,NA,Oh
ROSEMARY,NA,H Well you know um Hx
BETH,NA,you wanna but when you're moving you keep it
ROSEMARY,NA,you know Kris Nelson
SHERRY,NA,Yeah
ROSEMARY,NA,H Well when I I asked when I went in with my arm you know cause I had tr so much trouble with my elbow H And so while she was giving me the treatment one time I asked her about backs You know
SHERRY,NA,Mhm
ROSEMARY,NA,H and she said the l The newest theory is the opposite We They used to say H that you lie flat
SHERRY,NA,TSK H Oh I heard this one
ROSEMARY,NA,with your e With your knees up
SHERRY,NA,Yeah So that it will curve this way
ROSEMARY,NA,H So that it curves this way
SHERRY,NA,Yeah
ROSEMARY,NA,H She says now we're having em do H uh exercises
SHERRY,NA,The opposite Arching
ROSEMARY,NA,where you lie flat on your stomach
SHERRY,NA,Yeah
ROSEMARY,NA,and you lift your shoulders up
SHERRY,NA,Mm
ROSEMARY,NA,H And then you keep doing it until you can have your hands totally straight and your hips on the H I mean your arms totally straight
SHERRY,NA,Oh Yeah
ROSEMARY,NA,and your hips down
BETH,NA,Hm
ROSEMARY,NA,so that you're curved way up
SHERRY,NA,Right
ROSEMARY,NA,H So I started doing that and believe it or not my backache went away
SHERRY,NA,Really
BETH,NA,Really I'll tell Bill Cause H that
SHERRY,NA,But I can't
BETH,NA,One night that he was so sick
ROSEMARY,NA,THROAT
BETH,NA,when he first got sick and he couldn't He was walking stooped over his back hurt so bad
ROSEMARY,NA,H You have to You start out real
SHERRY,NA,Mhm
BETH,NA,Legs
ROSEMARY,NA,Just a little bit
BETH,NA,were numb
ROSEMARY,NA,You know
BETH,NA,We put four pillows under his knees
ROSEMARY,NA,H 
BETH,NA,and that backache just about went away
ROSEMARY,NA,COUGH COUGH H But you see that's always worked for me too but it comes back
SHERRY,NA,Hm
BETH,NA,Now his didn't though
ROSEMARY,NA,Well then that's what you You know different people have different ty kinds
BETH,NA,Well and it was probably just from being sick
ROSEMARY,NA,%
BETH,NA,That caused it and he just needed to relax it
ROSEMARY,NA,H TSK I am conc
BETH,NA,And that helped him relax
ROSEMARY,NA,Carolyn thinks she's got a kidney infection
BETH,NA,P Oh my God P Hx
SHERRY,NA,Hx

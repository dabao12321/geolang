NATHAN,AL,H Am I doing that right so far
KATHY,AL,Mhm
NATHAN,AL,TSK All the way down to that
KATHY,AL,Mhm TSK WH I WH think
NATHAN,AL,I don't think I am Do you
KATHY,AL,Hx H And you'd have to have that plus or minus
NATHAN,AL,
KATHY,AL,What
NATHAN,AL,I don't know what I did to get that Where did I get that square root of um ex squared
KATHY,AL,Because you brought this over here You brought three H over here divided by three H and then you have ex squared so if you want to find ex you have the square root of ex squared
NATHAN,AL,X I guess X all I can't figure out is what the square root of negative two thir thi two thirds is Would that be
KATHY,AL,i square root two
NATHAN,AL,i square root two thirds
KATHY,AL,o over three The whole thing would be over three BR Well BR No it couldn't be Square root of two thirds yeah
NATHAN,AL,H Hx
KATHY,AL,But then you got the other one Nathan
NATHAN,AL,Oh Hx WH gosh WH Hx hm Leah She snoozing on the floor
KATHY,AL,Mhm Not anymore you woke her up
NATHAN,AL,
KATHY,AL,H She's doing the karate kid Nathan
NATHAN,AL,She's like leave me alone Do I deserve this
KATHY,AL,H H
NATHAN,AL,I mean how would you like it when you're laying in bed
KATHY,AL,  H H
NATHAN,AL,somebody just grabbed your arm started swinging it around
KATHY,AL,I'd probably just slap em
NATHAN,AL,H P Ex squared equals one over the square root of that the square root of that ex equals the square root of one P
KATHY,AL,She's not even looking at me She's just looking like
NATHAN,AL,I know That's what I'm talking about
KATHY,AL,TSK
NATHAN,AL,So would that one be square root of one half
KATHY,AL,Mhm
NATHAN,AL,It would
KATHY,AL,Mhm Yep But do y'all have to do that um you have to like have it where you do that there's no H um
NATHAN,AL,fraction under the
KATHY,AL,under the in the denominator I mean no fraction under the
NATHAN,AL,Oh yeah
KATHY,AL,So then you just multiply the whole thing by the square root of two and you get the square root of two over two H
NATHAN,AL,Even for the top one Even for that one
KATHY,AL,No For I'm talking about for this one
NATHAN,AL,Oh H All you do is like go t two over one
KATHY,AL,You have the square root of one
NATHAN,AL,like that right
KATHY,AL,M-m Since you have the square root of two on the bottom to make that a square you have to multiply by the square root of two H And then you get two H and you multiply the top by the square root of two and you get square root of two
NATHAN,AL,
KATHY ,AL,hat I wanna rewind it and hear that back again
KATHY,AL, H H  H
NATHAN,AL,Cause I sure didn't catch it the first time  H Hx Hx You got the two and you take the square root of two
KATHY,AL,
NATHAN,AL,and you get the negative two
KATHY,AL,@
NATHAN,AL,which you take  the square
KATHY,AL, H
NATHAN,AL,and it comes to two
KATHY,AL,H I'm sorry H
NATHAN,AL,Hx So let's talk about this slowly as I write this down as you're saying it Alright H TSK This is what we came out with Right
KATHY,AL,It's But put it as the square root of one over the square root of two
NATHAN,AL,Oh TSK H And then you multiply that by the square root of two over the square root of two
KATHY,AL,Right
NATHAN,AL,H Uh is that what all those square root of twos are
KATHY,AL, That's what I was try H H
NATHAN,AL,
KATHY,AL,That's what I was trying to say
NATHAN,AL, H Okay I was wondering where all that square root two square root two
KATHY,AL,H That's what it was
NATHAN,AL,Then right here you'd get square root of two over two
KATHY,AL,Mhm
NATHAN,AL,See everything was square root two over two and two
KATHY,AL,H Right but then H what about this one
NATHAN,AL,on this one Let me do this one SWALLOW
KATHY,AL,But you have i you have i square root of three over square root of three I mean z H i square root of two over three square root of three I can't even say it right H
NATHAN,AL,Over do I have another i down here or just the one i
KATHY,AL,Um no Just one
NATHAN,AL,Okay P three X and X square root of three over square root of three and you get P H
KATHY,AL,i square root of six
NATHAN,AL,Yeah Over three
KATHY,AL,Is that right
NATHAN,AL,TSK I doubt it I really do
KATHY,AL,H H Hx
NATHAN,AL,I'm not kidding
KATHY,AL,You can't You can't multiply square roots like that can you Square root of two times square root of three is square root of six is it
NATHAN,AL,Yeah
KATHY,AL,Okay Well then that's fine Then that is right
NATHAN,AL,Isn't that c You can do that
KATHY,AL,Yeah
NATHAN,AL,Cause that's the same way you're multiplying there square root of nine that and square root of nine equals three
KATHY,AL,Yeah P okay P Where's the test
NATHAN,AL,P There ain't no telling P H SIGH
KATHY,AL,You have it I mean I have it H Hx H Okay The next one is TSK H THROAT TSK five ex times ex minus one COUGH COUGH
NATHAN,AL,Is that it
KATHY,AL,TSK H
NATHAN,AL,<X um X>
KATHY,AL,equals two times one minus ex
NATHAN,AL,H Leah
KATHY,AL,H
NATHAN,AL,Two times one minus ex
KATHY,AL,Yeah And that's easy you can do that
NATHAN,AL,Oh this is easy P Ex squared P Please say this will factor Will it
KATHY,AL,Na you do it
NATHA,AL, TSK H Well I mean that's just wasting time Cause if it's not Yeah
NATHAN,AL,It does
KATHY,AL,Mhm
NATHAN,AL,One and negative two-fifths
KATHY,AL,Mhm
NATHAN,AL,H And I can always put those back up into the top
KATHY,AL,THROAT
NATHAN,AL,and and see if they check Right H X Let me X just try the one X Five X THROAT I got zero equals zero
KATHY,AL,Tha that's right @
NATHAN,AL,And that's one
KATHY,AL,H Yeah H H
NATHAN,AL,Zero equals zero equals one
KATHY,AL,H Okay
NATHAN,AL,SING<X Fingerprint file X Hx you got me down
KATHY,AL,
NATHAN,AL,Come on SING
KATHY,AL,H Ex times
NATHAN,AL,Hang on Number eight H Ex times
KATHY,AL,two minus ex
NATHAN,AL,Two minus ex
KATHY,AL,H is less than or equal to
NATHAN,AL,WHISTLE I don't like these
KATHY,AL,three times ex minus four
NATHAN,AL,Three times ex minus four
KATHY,AL,Right
NATHAN,AL,TSK H Alright distribute first right
KATHY,AL,Mhm
NATHAN,AL,H P Two ex minus ex squared three ex minus twelve you get WH do that side so you get ex WH whoa I don't want to do that Negative ex squared WH<X two ex minus XX two minus ex H um plus twelve XXXX X>WH>P TSK TSK TSK Now do you factor this after you do that
KATHY,AL,Yeah
NATHAN,AL,Yeah H Oh but first I gotta take out that negative one don't I mean that negative
KATHY,AL,Mhm
NATHAN,AL,in front of that ex squared so I just H I can multiply that whole side by negative one X again though X
KATHY,AL,Yeah Then you flip that sign over
NATHAN,AL,I have to flip that sign over if I do that
KATHY,AL,Mhm
NATHAN,AL,See it's little rules like that that I'm not gonna remember So if it's a if it's less than or equal to then H and there's a minus you have to flip the sign Okay Are you tired
KATHY,AL,P Not really I mean kind of but
NATHAN,AL,I'm gonna go home in just a few minutes
KATHY,AL,Why P
NATHAN,AL,H Cause I can work on this at home and let you get some sleep
KATHY,AL,Hx HITS_NATHAN_WITH_PAPER
NATHAN,AL,Ouch SNIFF THROAT Okay S H so you say ex plus four is greater than or equal to zero X H P So you say ex is greater than or equal to negative four and ex P three
KATHY,AL,Or
NATHAN,AL,Oh is that one of the ones where you have to do or
KATHY,AL,Yeah
NATHAN,AL,H And if it's less than do you still do or
KATHY,AL,H No that's if it's um in the in the b in between those two numbers you know If there's like a H like this one don't look H But if there's like a ex in the middle
NATHAN,AL,H
KATHY,AL,Well no that's a or H If you have like one number on one side
NATHAN,AL,P Mm P
KATHY,AL,and it says
NATHAN,AL,Yes
KATHY,AL,greater than or equal to ex
NATHAN,AL,like
KATHY,AL,and than l that one's less than or equal to
NATHAN,AL,like two is less than or equal to ex
KATHY,AL,is less than or equal to
NATHAN,AL,which is XX less than or equal to%
KATHY,AL,less tha- less than or equal to
NATHAN,AL,six
KATHY,AL,Right
NATHAN,AL,SWALLOW THROAT So the final ans So that's the answer Right
KATHY,AL,Mhm
NATHAN,AL,Hx P Number nine P
KATHY,AL,Okay I don't know this one so
NATHAN,AL,You don't know how to do this one So we in trouble
KATHY,AL,Well you apparently knew how to do it
NATHAN,AL,Did I get it right
KATHY,AL,H Well you didn't get the whole thing right
NATHAN,AL,H XX
KATHY,AL,H But you Well you just missed one part of it
NATHAN,AL,So what's that problem
KATHY,AL,Um absolute value
NATHAN,AL,Okay
KATHY,AL,H of one-half minus ex over three
NATHAN,AL,WHISTLE Ex over three oops Okay
KATHY,AL,is less I mean is greater than or equal to two-thirds
NATHAN,AL,Just plain old two-thirds
KATHY,AL,Mhm
NATHAN,AL,H H How do you get rid of the absolute value things Don't you
KATHY,AL,X I don't X TSK H You put is less than or equal to two-thirds Or is greater than I mean is greater than or equal to two-thirds and then don't you have like i or is less than and is less than or equal to negative two thirds
NATHAN,AL,What Can I see what I did
KATHY,AL,H Yeah But when you when you have absolute value when you take the absolute value off H and you put negative two-thirds on this side too
NATHAN,AL,First I'll just get a common denominator So I can do that
KATHY,AL,You can't do it when it's in the absolute value
NATHAN,AL,XX
KATHY,AL,though
NATHAN,AL,Well I did right there Is that why I missed it
KATHY,AL,H TSK But see if you wanna do that then at first you bring
NATHAN,AL,THROAT So I only did one part of it in other words
KATHY,AL,Mhm Just bring nega Just bring two-thirds over to the other side Negative two-thirds over to the other side
NATHAN,AL,And make it equal to zero
KATHY,AL,No No keep that there H But then have
NATHAN,AL,Another one over there
KATHY,AL,Yeah have is less than or equal to H negative two thirds And that's not absolute value anymore
NATHAN,AL,Well see H we've never done it like that H
KATHY,AL,Let me see If that's how you do it
NATHAN,AL,I mean I'm sure you probably can do it that way
KATHY,AL,I don't know if that's how you do it or not Cause I haven't done this in probably about as long as you have H Oops H Hx WH God WH
NATHAN,AL,It's my own fault I shouldn't have waited so long to get math over with I should've got it over with right out right out of high school
KATHY,AL,GASP
NATHAN,AL,DRINK
KATHY,AL,Oo
NATHAN,AL,Hx
KATHY,AL,A bug
NATHAN,AL,Hey Leah H H She looks so tired
KATHY,AL,I know
NATHAN,AL,She's eating that bug
KATHY,AL,H H
NATHAN,AL,Is that what she's doing
KATHY,AL,Yuck I guess Yeah that's how you do it
NATHAN,AL,You can do it that way
KATHY,AL,Mhm
NATHAN,AL,BURP Let me see the pencil Hx
KATHY,AL,H But then I didn't get what she got I guess she Yeah you can X put it X so X<WH square root of that WH>X Oh no it's not gonna work that way You don't have it in the middle See I put it in the middle H Seven halves is greater than or equal to H But you can't put it in the middle cause if it's gonna be g Hx H Yeah if it's gonna be greater than that then it's not gonna be less than that Well I guess it can
NATHAN,AL,H WH God WH H So one way I could do it Hx
KATHY,AL,H Well s No Wait a minute now See l look what she did H She um flipped that sign over X But X uh when she you divide by negative two you have to flip all the signs over which you k did Yeah cause you got that right it's right here
NATHAN,AL,H Oh gosh H You know what I'm just gonna skip this one
KATHY,AL,No you're not you're gonna do it Now
NATHAN,AL,So I can't start by d
KATHY,AL,H Unh-unh Not finding a common denominator You have to ha bring
NATHAN,AL,Well I can do find one side by doing that can't I
KATHY,AL,Yeah but why don't you p just put the other put H once you have negative two-thirds on the other side then you can find a common denom f na buh buh buh buh H common denominator for the whole thing and it's gonna be the same denominator
NATHAN,AL,Well what's the common denominator of bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh
KATHY,AL,
NATHAN,AL,H H
KATHY,AL,H H I didn't mean that I meant once you bring it over there
NATHAN,AL,SNIFF I know what you meant H I don't ever remember us doing anything like that though Q Well add it onto the other side Q H There's like a way you always can get rid of those absolute value bars in problems isn't there X Hey X Can I use some of this
KATHY,AL,H Oh Yeah Mm TSK See yeah H Here it's absolute values Right here
NATHAN,AL,H TSK And it's doing it the way that you were doing it
KATHY,AL,I'm trying to find one like that one
NATHAN,AL,H See that's the problem there's so many different types H That I'm sitting here st worrying about this one right here and there probably won't even be l one like this on the test
KATHY,AL,I know
NATHAN,AL,There'll be a different one
KATHY,AL,H So what do you do You find a inequality with an absolute value in it which H there's one right there Mhm See I sure didn't see any in the
NATHAN,AL,examples
KATHY,AL,Hm-m TSK See There's no TSK There it is
NATHAN,AL,H THROAT
KATHY,AL,See Here it is H Absolute value of that you brought brought negative four over to the other side
NATHAN,AL,P Okay SWALLOW P
KATHY,AL,And all that
NATHAN,AL,See that just proves that she puts problems on there that we've never gone over I know we've never done one like that where you do that H Can you Do you wanna do that when it's less than or can you do that when it's greater than too
KATHY,AL,Yeah Th Either way
NATHAN,AL,So if it's pointed this way you just put another one pointing this way over here
KATHY,AL,Right
NATHAN,AL,Okay
KATHY,AL,WH Where'd you get that one WH Hx H That's a big one Hx H
NATHAN,AL,Hx You're not kidding X
KATHY,AL,That's my thumbnail
NATHAN,AL,SIGH SNIFF
KATHY,AL,SWALLOW
NATHAN,AL,YAWN H Now I just get a common denominator for the whole thing
KATHY,AL,Mhm Well take out those absolute value things they'll screw you up
NATHAN,AL,Yeah And now this'll be six right SWALLOW Hx Is that right
KATHY,AL,Mhm
NATHAN,AL,Now what do you do
KATHY,AL,Subtract three from the middle
NATHAN,AL,And y To which side
KATHY,AL,To both sides
NATHAN,AL,To both sides Okay
KATHY,AL,THROAT
NATHAN,AL,P Negative XX P
KATHY,AL,two ex
NATHAN,AL,Alright H P To one then after that you have to P take out the negatives
KATHY,AL,Yeah Divide by Well just ta Divide by negative two
NATHAN,AL,Oh you can't get that by
KATHY,AL,XX
NATHAN,AL,ex by itself
KATHY,AL,Yeah
NATHAN,AL,H
KATHY,AL,And when you divide by a negative
NATHAN,AL,Hx
KATHY,AL,you have to flip the signs
NATHAN,AL,TSK Yeah H Okay
KATHY,AL,And when you do that it's gonna be a or H Because if you look at it cause you know it can't be greater than seven-halves and less than negative halve at the sa one-half at the same time So it's gonna be either ex is less than or equal to negative one-half H or
NATHAN,AL,Okay
KATHY,AL,SNIFF SWALLOW
NATHAN,AL,Hx P Will you pass me some of that tea please H Oh thank you DRINK Hx DRINK Hx H Number ten How many problems are on this test P
KATHY,AL,Twelve
NATHAN,AL,Oh good
KATHY,AL,What did you want to do after this test
NATHAN,AL,That's it I guess
KATHY,AL,You gonna study some more tomorrow then right
NATHAN,AL,Oh definitely
KATHY,AL,Okay Ex plus four over three ex minus two is less than zero
NATHAN,AL,WH Is WH less than zero
KATHY,AL,Right
NATHAN,AL,H SIGH WH Gosh WH Is this the c Is this the same class I'm taking Kathy Are you sure we're doing work from the same class that I'm that I'm that I go to every night
KATHY,AL,I don't know H H Are we H It's got the same name but that's about it Okay
NATHAN,AL,I don't even know how you start this one do you
KATHY,AL,Yeah I think so but I'm not sure Cause the way I start it
NATHAN,AL,Do I Did I have anything written on the test
KATHY,AL,M-m

JEFF,PA,TSK H We often meditate I think on the love of Christ and there are many ways to do it and those who have meditated on the love of Christ have often done so in terms of the cross itself H have imagined again and afresh uh his uh bleeding wounds uh see him as he died on the cross H but AUD NOSE_BLOW JEFF wherever we turn TSK H uh in considering the love of Christ we turn always to the Gospel records don't we We we turn to the Word of God We turn to the real Jesus as he's described H And uh H There there is where our meditation always centers AUD COUGH COUGH JEFF Hx That we might know him H and uh see the wonder H of his love TSK H And not only hear him as he cries why have you forsaken me H but uh see him also in his seeking love H as the risen Lord H Uh see him uh with that fish breakfast Hx by the Lake of Galilee H SWALLOW Broiling fish H Don't you like that H You know he had that uh H he had that breakfast all cooking H While the disciples were still out in the boat And then uh of course he has a special interview with Peter Not the first time he'd seen him he made a special resurrection appearance uh to Peter H But uh there in the morning early morning in the Lake of Galilee And there are cocks crowing in the distance TSK H And Jesus says to Peter H do you love me more than these TSK Simon son of Jonah do you love me more than these H Three times the question AUD THROAT JEFF TSK H Because you see H as uh we were saying a bit ago the love and the service go together Don't they H If Peter is to be restored in service he has to be restored in love TSK H And when Peter says uh I love you then Jesus says uh feed my sheep tend my lambs care for my little ones We we can't love others in the name of Christ unless the love for others is a overflow of our love for the Lord himself The people that we're called to love are unfortunately H not uh warrantably lovable H Hx We uh Hx H Hx H The source of our love is not how appealing they are although we can praise God for his image in them and rejoice in the many SM evidences of God's common grace in their lives SM but H nevertheless uh basically the the fountain of our love H i is uh the seeking love of the savior H The self-denying love That is uh willing to serve in his name H Do you love me TSK H You know Jesus didn't ask Peter those questions to undercut his love or his faith H He asked those questions to establish it TSK H And uh Jesus does the same with you my friend Hx he does the same He does ask you this morning do you love me Do you really love me But he asks it in order that you'll be able to say at last with Peter Lord you know everything H You know my heart H And Lord you know that in spite of everything H yes Lord I do love you H Well the saving love of uh the Father Hx and the Son is also the saving love of the Spirit and that's why I read that section from Romans eight H Uh you see God's love is is present in the Spirit TSK H TSK H There there's a wonderful theology of the Spirit in uh in the Scriptures .E+specially of course in the New Testament H Um TSKH Bultmann in his uh commentary on uh Romans eight uh talks about uh the two ways in which the Spirit i is spoken of H And uh h he unfortunately uses anthropological terms to describe it H uh he talks about uh H the the the Spirit in uh H the sense of mana as in uh H animism where the spirit you have a spirit of of a tree or a a stone or something like that H and then you have the more personal concept of the Spirit uh H uh both an impersonal and a personal concept of the Spirit H Now I d I don't care for his analogy but uh the point is well taken H Uh the point is that Paul does speak of the Spirit both as possessor H and as possessed H You see the Spirit possesses us H Uh as Christians we are not demon possessed we are Holy Spirit possessed H And uh H Holy Spirit possession H has a close relationship to demon possession H uh the close relationship is what makes it so different H You see uh demon possession is always destructive H because uh Satan can't create H And the demon-possessed man in Gadare Remember Hx H uh he couldn't even give his name When Jesus asked him what his name was Hx H Uh he His personality was destroyed You know how C S Lewis has done that in his uh H uh adult novels Uh H uh but uh there it is S emon possession is personality destructive It depersonalizes because uh H Satan can only corrode he can't create He can only destroy H But Holy Spirit POUND pos+session is no less real possession H only it has the op+posite effect H The Holy Spirit you see is the cre+ator Spirit who brought uh order out POUND of chaos the Holy Spirit is the one who orders H the Holy Spirit is the one who frees uh liberates H uh the H uh the the the Gadarene demoniac thought he was free because nobody could tie him up you see AUD THROAT JEFF he could go anywhere do anything uh absolute freedom Right H and he could treat people he hi he didn't have to dress any particular way no dress code H and so he stripped it all off And the he uh H he could uh d treat people any way he wanted to so whenever they came by he beat them up And uh AUD COUGH COUGH JEFF H and uh then if there was nobody handy to beat up he picked up a stone and uh tore his own flesh apart H There's demonic liberty Hx H But uh Holy Spirit liberty doesn't work that way See H Uh uh now m you'll accuse me of thinking uh of Holy Spirit liberty in too strictly Presbyterian terms because uh AUD JEFF H I remind you that that man once he was delivered was seated clothed and in his right mind MANY LAUGHTER JEFF Uh and THROATSNIFF THROAT H H H And we'll pass over other uh uh Scriptural accounts AUD COUGH JEFF like the lame man healed by the Beautiful Gate at the temple who went in leaping and dancing and praising the Lord MANY LAUGHTER JEFF See that H uh that's a little different but COUGH COUGH COUGh H But uh you Presbyterians want to do everything decently and in order H Uh but but the Holy Spirit remember is the spirit of both Right He's the spirit of order he's the spirit of ardor H And and the Holy Spirit uh uh s the one H uh who has uh H ordered our lives And as he possesses us He orders us And he gives us the order of love If you love me Jesus said keep my commandments Uh I wanna say a little bit more about that in a moment H The obedience of love H But the Holy Spirit is the one who orders our lives H uh ontrols our lives is in possession of our lives H but the Holy Spirit's also given to us see he's not only H the possessor H he's also the one who is possessed We possess him H He dwells in our hearts H Uh we have not only the gifts of the Spirit in the plural H but we have the gift of the Spirit We have the Holy Spirit himself given to us The promise of the Father H Uh they the disciples were to wait until that great promise was given the gift of the Holy Spirit H And so the Holy Spirit given to us H uh f works in us Uh H that sense of the presence of God's love H And that's why uh Paul says in Romans five that God H pours out his love in our hearts H By the Holy Spirit H Now there the love that's poured out does not describe H the love that we have for God although that is the fruit of the Spirit you know love joy peace so on H Uh but n that passage in Romans five Paul isn't talking about H uh the gift of love that we have for God H he's talking about the gift of love that God has for us H Because he goes on to describe that love of God God commends his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us H So it's God's love for us that's poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit given to us H Which is uh TSK H again TSK H uh a wonderful reality TSK H Because if God didn't do that uh we wouldn't have a love for God There's no spring of that divine love within us H It comes from him And it does come from him and he does give it H And so the Spirit is the spirit of Hx uh adoption The spirit of sonship H Now to be the spirit of sonship he has to be also the spirit of fatherhood right Hx H H Uh to make us POUND a+ware POUND that we are children of God H uh we have to know that he is our father And so H it is the love of God made real to our hearts the knowledge that he does love us that he is present with us H that uh becomes of course then the source H of our uh love toward him H Um TSK H uh friends AUD COUGH JEFF uh H there's there's nothing more important For the whole balance and stability and progress and growth of our Christian lives H Than to realize again and again and again H the uh the wonder of our union with Jesus Christ Through the Spirit Because it's in Jesus Christ that we are united to the Father H and it is by the Spirit that Christ is present in our hearts H and it's by the Spirit that the Father is present in our hearts H Two aspects of union with Christ i I think you all know this theology but it always pays X to X think about it again H The representative union the vital union H The representative union H The basis of our salvation H When Christ died we died Hx H Because he died for us He died as our representative he died in our place H uh he died as uh H uh the one H uh who bore our sins In his own body H on the tree So he was our representative Right H And he represented us not only as Paul teaches not only when he died for us but when he rose for us H And then he ascended into the heavenly places and where he is we are H And that's why Paul says in Ephesians that we are in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus Why H Representatively Where he is we are H Now that's a tremendously important of course foundational life-transforming truth H It's happened Hx See Hx H you are a a new creature in Christ because you're united to him H You have triumphed over sin and death H You have died to sin H And Paul's reasoning about how we ought to live is always grounded in that AUD COUGH JEFF H Uh you know in Colossians Uh H it's because H Christ rose that we are to seek the things which are above You are risen with Christ Seek the things which are above H Because you died with Christ therefore mortify sin in your members H Put to death sin because it has died H In other words the imperative is always grounded in the indicative Because of what Christ did for us therefore H uh we live out of the fact the reality the accomplishment H of his perfect work H And don't forget Jesus not only paid the price of your sins H but remember that he lived a perfect life for you hx H That the white robe of righteousness that you wear in that last day is the robe of Christ's righteousness So H it's all that Christ MRC did for you MRC H uh Jesus was baptized for you Hx H Uh let it be done to fill all righteousness The righteousness he had to fill for you See he he did it all for you H But then of course the other side of it is it's not only representative it's also vital Jesus Christ is the vine H and we are the branches Y we're united to him Our life is drawn from Christ There is the uh H uh not only the H the the legal uh aspect of that which Christ did for us as our representative H there is the vital aspect of what Christ does in us as he lives in us and dwells in us and has fellowship with us and H and we walk with him H Uh H uh every H uh y y you know i t's uh H it's been long fashionable in theological circles to uh sniff at the hymn H uh I walked in the garden alone while the dew was still on the roses you know uh all this uh romantic business and uh H and not a shred of theology in the whole hymn and yet everybody perversely seems to love it H Uh well uh H uh H I I I think I think the reason it's so loved in spite of its uh H uh uh theological vacuity H uh is that it's uh experientially MANY LAUGHTER JEFF uh retty much on target We've all known those uh precious times of uh H of genuine fellowship with the Lord H that uh H that we can describe only with great difficulty H And uh it's true you see uh we are vitally united to Jesus Christ Uh we do know him H and the knowledge that we have of him H is the knowledge of love We just simply love him H Uh H we uh TSK H ow the mystics the Christian myth mystics l love to talk about Hx H we've got some kind of time constraint here what uh uh what MANY LAUGHTER JEFF w H w w when do weDAN,WI,I thinkJEFF,PA,WhenDAN,WI,I think we're done when you are soJEFF,PA,H well I I gotta beDAN,WI,finish what you have <X to say X>JEFF,WI, I I well I'll I yeah Let me try to finish what I'm talking about here but H but uh H SM there there I don't often get chance to talk to types like you SM you know it's wonderful MANY LAUGHTERJEFF,WI," H H uh it's particularly wonderful cause I know you know everything I'm saying anyway,s@so you can smile affirmatively and that encourages me that's great uh but throat MANY LAUGHTER"JEFF,WI, But uh H but really the the that uh you know the Christian mystics talked about climbing Jacob's ladder And uh H uh you you you'd come up the ladder and when you get at the top you fling yourself down at the very gate of heaven And maybe uh H maybe the gate will open Y you can't control it you don't know when it will open but maybe it will open H And when it opens then uh it's uh H light bursting in your inner heart Hx H And uh H once you've had that experience you'd give anything to have the experience repeated And so uh H you go through any amount of discipline and uh try out different forms of discipline and uh H you recite the Jesus prayer thousands of times with the monks of Mount Athos and uh H and uh sooner or later uh you think it may happen Uh the uh you you may gain that experience H Well now uh you know there are experiences of ecstasy tha uh that can be induced by a transformation of consciousness H and uh I think Christians sometimes have uh H uh mingled that uh psychological experience uh H whether it's the left part or or the right part of the brain taking over or something H I don't think um uh H the um the psychologists are as sure as they once were or even the neurologists about how some of those things happen but uh H uh at any rate H uh you see AUD COUGHJEFF,WI, it isn't that we have to climb the ladder H H And uh I'm I'm sorry that that whole H episode with Jacob got misunderstood H All because uh H all because of the Hebrew preposition al That uh wasn't taken account of H Uh that see H uh he he stood uh upon not it ee he Jacob st saw the stairway not a painter's ladder of course but a H a tower of Babel type of thing a uh H a zigarot r right You got a zigarot and H which was made for the gods to touch down at the top and then they could come down uh to the bottom You know it was like a little heliport for the gods there That was he idea MANY LAUGHTERJEFF,WI, But but uh th they they'd come down there'd be a temple at the bottom and then uh H the god could be with the people H But uh AUDJEFF,WI, H uh but it it wasn't that that God that that uh Jacob saw God at the top of the ladder up in Heaven H uh God stood H uh upon him H Uh the the masculine uh there the uh H v v v vowel with the little dot over it you know the H the the holem H Uh he he he's uh h he stood upon him H uh which is the common Hebrew expression H and you know that's what it is because the second time when God appeared to b h uh j Jacob at Bethel H uh the same expression is used He went up from upon him See Uh it's the same expression H So God had come down the ladder That's what we miss H He wasn't standing up there at the top H uh he came down the ladder H And uh when he came down the ladder he stood over Jacob and revealed himself to Jacob H And that's why Jacob said this is the house of God this is the gate of Heaven H It was the House of God he said because God was in this place and I didn't know it H See H H it it's this is Bethel here because here God has come to us H So God was revealing himself to Jacob H and God reveals himself to us He comes to us H And uh H he seeks us As we seek him H And our love is always in response to his love H And it's the assurance that your God loves you that he seeks you that he's with you That he comes to you H It's this assurance that draws you H to repentance and draws you to faith and draws you to himself H Um H the uh H h salvation is of the Lord H And uh it's the Lord's love H who quickens your love H Well TSK I'm not going to say uh th the rest of the things I I had in mind to say H But uh I you can fill out the talk for me would you please sometime H the H the commitment of love the obedience of love If you love me keep my commandments Hx H Um H remember uh Mary's adoration Uh when she uh brought the spikenard and uh opened it and poured it out on the feet of Jesus just before he went to the cross H And Judas criticized her remember H Uh because he said this could have been given to the poor H uh he he he was the first old-fashioned liberal Hx Don't worship Jesus but help the poor H Uh but uh MANY LAUGHTERJEFF,WI, H Uh y you see uh H Hx uh w what what was the answer What was the answer that Jesus uh gave Uh H uh n let her do this Let her keep it Not in the sense of preserving the ointment she was pouring it out but in the sense of observing it H Observing a a an observance against his burial H Uh so she realized what his death meant H and she realized who he was H He said the poor you have with you always but me H you have not always H A tremendous assurance of his own deity Who else could say something like that Hunh H But Jesus said it H and uh uh you see what that says to us Hx TSK H Uh if our Lord were here then we could pour out perfume on his feet H He's not here But who is H The poor you have with you always Hx H So whose feet can we anoint Hx The feet of the poor in his name See H Uh love uh uh doesn't mean Hx H h climbing up Jacob's ladder to the heavenlies where nobody else can be around H The love of God is experienced in the community of the saints it's experienced as

projects that uh H um Intervarsity is involved in H and friends um H these H these projects H even if uh they're working about rebuilding old houses or whatever H they are not things that have nothing

DARREN,LA,FALL
NICK,LA,Boom Hx In a Hane-goshi That spring hip H With an outer winding pull It's okay if you hit it low but if he's bent over you can and you hit it low you're not gonna hit nothing From here I don't have I have too much distance between us But from here

NICK A,LA,right X X
NICK,LA,Gotta pull going this way
BENTON,LA,Okay I need to have him here
NICK,LA,Jerk him You don't have to g wrap both arms up Just one really jerk him around
BENTON,LA,Okay X and then spring the hip up
NICK,LA,Spring your hip Take a high collar grip Lug if he's bent over that far you wouldn't start off like that Now You can just swing all the way around and grab that arm
BENTON,LA,Okay
NICK,LA,Just No
BENTON,LA,GROAN
NICK,LA,There's no such thing as a Hane-uchi-mata You fall straight on your face
BENTON,LA,Oh
NICK,LA,Alright Hx you don't have the outer pull going for you You still don't have enough outer pull He oughtta be wound up on his tiptoes Way out to here Now spring your hip
BENTON,LA,Okay
NICK,LA,Spring your hip
BILL,LA,GRUNT FALL
NICK,LA,There It's hard too for you w your legs are so short and he's so tall Try it again And Martin if your hip joints were okay
BENTON,LA,Yeah
NICK,LA,He'd b be just perfect for you to okay for one thing you're backing in
BENTON,LA,Okay
NICK,LA,Watch From here bend over CLAP From right here
BENTON,LA,Okay
NICK,LA,X Jock X him into it
BENTON,LA,Mhm
NICK,LA,I've gotta still jerk him up on his tiptoes to throw him H from here See that half half instep
BENTON,LA,Spot the hip
NICK,LA,I'm jerking I still get under him don't I
BILL,LA,FALL
NICK,LA,Then I'm on him It's hard to control that throw Did you land off the mat
BILL,LA,No no
NICK,LA,Good Uchi-<X mother X Koka X THROAT
NICK,LA,Tell you what Martin let's pull this down XXX Okay Alright Lug Hx Give a more upward round pull From here Watch I get s Hx best best way to do it is to feel it I guess Bend over Alright I'm gonna come to here now I jerk up first then I spin around
BENTON,LA,Okay
NICK,LA,And I'm gonna let it go God you're heavy Hx Then I'm gonna let go here here see how I got you wound up
BENTON,LA,FALL
NICK D,LA,wn here This is not a good throw to throw Lug in Hx H Hx X H Hx
NICK,LA,I would suggest doing this throw on combatants and opponents of equal height And size Lug would be much better Hx for a Sode-makikomi Hx H but not a Hande-maki Hane-makikomi H Cause the Hane you add that spring Alright Hx I'm having to use my legs to throw his weight H Instead of using Sode-makikomi
BENTON,LA,FALL GRUNT
NICK a,LA,d get the outside of his legs and I can make that a pretty throw Alright Hx And with the Makikomi technique with it you don't have Hx H the Tsuri-komi The lifting pull that you would normally have H You don't have your right hand to help you with it H All you have is an outer winding pull with the left hand H It's gotta go up out Hx and around Let's give it a try Throw throw Bill again X Hx THROAT
NICK,LA,Now spring the hip
BILL,LA,GRUNT FALL
NICK,LA,That's better
JED,LA,P Yeah P
NICK,LA,Much better Now let's throw it again and not have to stop and think about where the foot goes Now X Just one moment X The more acute angle that that knee gets at the more MRC power w you have with your spring MRC from your hip joint From here even if I'm doing Hane-goshi if I get that that knee bent at ninety degrees right here well I can blast him from here
BILL,LA,FALL
NICK,LA,I've got a lot of spring with it Also lay the instep of the foot Toes extremely well-pointed To the inside of his calf I mean his his uh thigh at the bend of his knee I don't care if your heel slides up into his crotch For a a Hane-makikomi Now uh Hx Hane-goshi I'd prefer that you do it a little bit different But Hane-makikomi the higher up it gets the more spring you get Yoshi
BENTON,LA,Is this the right position here
NICK,LA,Your knees need to be bent Now pull Pull pull pull and spr and spring Spring
BENT,LA,N Okay I'm just trying to get this X THROAT
BENTON,LA,this middle position
NICK,LA,Alright watch even though he's bent over I still have to get in
BENTON,LA,Okay
NICK,LA,I've got to get him loaded Look at his look at his heels Is his heel up
BENTON,LA,Yes
NICK,LA,Alright from here now I've g I'm got to be lower H X come on back side of the hands X
BILL,LA,GRUNT FALL
NICK,LA,And then I spring him off If he's bent over it's extremely hard for me to get H under him with a standard Tsuri-komi grip Well this way I'm just scooting my butt in there on him H It doesn't matter if I hit him H a little bit above my his obi with my buttocks As long as that leg is automatically cocking as it goes in H Then I'm throwing my weight straight forward Hx
BENTON,LA,Okay
NICK,LA,With that outer winding pull It's all-important Jerk him around In a big circle
BILL,LA,FALL
NICK,LA,Okay Everything was there but the leg Bill went into Uchi-mata I might have to have you throw Uchi-mata a couple times so you can throw a Hane-goshi Think of it Hx as a very short inverted kick Like that You know how you can use SLAP inverted kick Up very close range
BENTON,LA,Mhm
NICK,LA,That's exactly what you're doing Hx Kicking the inside of his thigh
BENTON,LA,Okay
NICK,LA,This time do an inverted kick on the inside of his thigh when you do it Go into it and load him up two or three times Hx Uchi-komi Hx Alright Hx Bend your knees as you go in too You're just straight and straight and lock-kneed There S better Now throw
BENTON,LA,Hx Hx
NICK,LA,Relax Relax and throw
BILL,LA,FALL GRUNT
NICK,LA,Better Better You're still sliding up that leg you're not springing it Bill let's see you throw a couple times Throw me Hx It's hot in here Thank you Hx
BILL,LA,Okay it was
NICK,LA,Now I'm gonna be a sucker and watch your feet This Now you're just walking in on me man you have you have no outer winding pull here Jerk me to you Hoo there we go I'm on my tiptoes what are you waiting for
BILL,LA,GRUNT
NICK,LA,FALL
BILL,LA,Not quite far enough in Hx
NICK,LA,A little shaky but basic as long as you're getting my head to where it'll clear and won't snap my neck you'll be doing fine Make me a happy camper Ah here an added exp H an added attraction What are we gonna do now I've got my hand on your hip Whoa There we go That's it beau Throw

NICK,LA,Boy that's a hard fall Hx H Hx
JED,LA,Oh
NICK,LA,X Ippon X GASP Alright that's where Hane-makikomi comes in Now Hx the traditional way to do it is not all bent over It's from a regular grip Hx And I'll still go Hx
BILL,LA,FALL
NICK,LA,Not a real Hx H Which w that one wasn't a very clean pretty throw
BILL,LA,XX functional
NICK,LA,Ah f Hx well it would have been better H had my leg stayed lower Traditional Hane H Hane uh H Goshi Hx leg Hx
BILL,LA,FALL
NICK,LA,There
BILL,LA,That was pretty
NICK,LA,But I like the Hane-makikomi H when it's used on a player Hx who's fighting you in that extreme Hx defensive stance H While he's down in a X deep X jigo Preferably with his left foot forward Pressing against you with that left hand Keeping you out Doing this number X Goes in X H see he's already eliminated this place Hx H Hx H All you have to do is jerk me around to it and come to me From there Jerk Hook And then spring X me X right there That's it Alright practice it on Darren a couple times I wanna see it X Think if you X tried the throw
BILL,LA,WH Okay WH X X Can you tell X

JED,LA,Yes
NICK,LA,in the front I can't see what's going on you're out here right here on the side
JED,LA,XXX X I've noticed something that your sensei is doing that you're not doing He's reaching for the mat He's in there and winds up
NICK,LA,Yeah
JED,LA,he's reaching for the mat with this arm And your arm's way up here high You're like way up high off the ground H and your sensei H is VOX way down like this VOX By the time he gets to the end of the throw See the difference So you're wrapping H and you're thinking I gotta make this throw what am I gonna do and Nick H is going for the mat with this arm He's H into a f almost like a forward roll mode The other difference that I noticed between you Hx and your sensei is that this foot is way out here This the your
NICK,LA,Are they trying to throw over the entire hip section
JED,LA,with th Mhm And and and and when Nick throws it H so pretty like he does he's got the H his foot much closer to the middle of his opponent's center of gravity H
BENTON,LA,Kay
JED,LA,S you're so wide that if you lift up H when you lift up to make the springing motion what happens is you fall this way real quick
NICK,LA,That is it
JED,LA,And you don't have enough to go like that Try it one time Reach for the ground with your wrapping arm Uh uh uh
BENTON,LA,GRUNT
BILL,LA,FALL
NICK,LA,Better X there X
JED,LA,Yeah It's better Reach

JED,LA,H Reach VOX way like this VOX Like you were doing a front roll out
NICK,LA,XXXX
JED,LA,And and stand on this foot so that you are more balanced Just a little bit more but you you're going down I mean
NICK,LA,Step in X when you have his b X right between his legs No step deeper
JED,LA,X Won't settle X
NICK,LA,Step deeper
BENTON,LA,Okay
NICK L,LA,ok how d Now Get your foot over here X X Bit more X
NICK,LA,Step right between his legs

BENTON,LA,Ah so Hx
NICK,LA,Try it again Alright you notice the difference in the foot position what hi what how much that helped
BENTON,LA,Mhm
NICK,LA,Step directly between his legs with your advancing foot No no no no no
BENTON,LA,Ah
NICK,LA,You're not not between his legs
JED,LA,Now reach that arm Reach that arm
NICK,LA,Shoot it
JED,LA,Reach that arm through
BILL,LA,FALL
JED,LA,The more you reach that arm through L let me add one Let me add one thing to it to make it cause it is a hard fall if you're H throwing it contest style if you're throwing it demo style H somebody once told me H that that the way to practice H all the Makikomi-waza H was to go down like this To take this foot if you're throwing right-hand throws H and to take this foot H and stick it VOX all the way through VOX like this
NICK,LA,Yep
JED,LA,H And just stick it All the way H behind you like this And as you go down and you roll like that Okay H and if you do this in demo uh in demo fashion H you'll be so low to the ground H by the time that your opponent hits the ground Hx that you'll be real nice to him And that way I mean Hx H you can intensify you can always intensify throwing SLAP throw it harder H But the mark of a good H judo throw is to be able to Hx do you see the people throw Seoi so nice H they can do they could throw their grandmother and it doesn't even hurt Hx WH She goes ah That felt good WH So you can do that
NICK,LA,Mm
JED,LA,H by sticking that leg Hx all the way through X just X like that As you get H You follow what I'm saying
BENTON,LA,Yes sir
NICK,LA,You don't have to drive em through the mat
JED,LA,That that's a way that you can Hx practice it over and over Hx in a demo style H and be so low to the ground Hx that it's a real nice H it's about as good as you can get a Makikomi for your uke H It's really not that bad H And you could Hx H it's it's H
NICK,LA,Throw X him X and let him see
JED ,LA,lright Alright S so we're coming over like this coming in like this Hx X FALL
JED,LA,alright
NICK,LA,Nice easy clean fall Look how tight he is to my chest Look at his body position right here There is no You couldn't slide a postcard between us
BENTON,LA,X I don't think you'd even do it between the hip X to to X get X the hips
JED,LA,Well do you wanna do one more

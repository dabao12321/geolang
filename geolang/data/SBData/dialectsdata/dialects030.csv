DANNY,IL,H This morning we're gonna be looking in the book of Exodus And we've been talking about uh Hx Vision And hearing from God H I was trying to come up with a definition in fact I I looked it up in the encyclopedia for vision H And Hx there is definitely a definition several uh and I didn't really like any of them TSK H uh TSK so I thought I'd try to come up with one of my own TSK Jim Larson was uh sharing a quote from Yogi Bara last night and I wanted to share that this morning H He says you gotta be careful when you don't know where you're going because you might not get there SM Which says so much that we need to know where we're going SM And vision really has to do with H having an idea of where you're going Our mission is a goal or task which one is destined to accomplish H Our vision and here's the here's the definition I came up with you can write this down but uh H uh don't use it unless you uh agree with it
AUD,NA,
DANNY,IL,TSK H It's mentally seeing
AUD,NA,
DANNY,IL,where one hopes to be in a specific period of time H It's in your imagination in your hopes Hx that you're looking ahead And h trying to see where you will be in a specific period period of time So our vision for the next few years Our vision for H uh the TSK next ten years Whatever H Uh what is our vision As a church planter Pastor Queen came TSK H having grown up here and having gone off to to school to seminary H God brought him back to start a church And he began to seek God's uh vision for the church H And through his own personal experience and through H the Scripture TSK and God gave him a vision for a church that was committed to being a part of what God was doing H a church that was invested in building the Kingdom of God By caring for people where their needs were and by sharing the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ TSK Our vision is is a direction of involvement toward a final destination When I started thinking about missions I thought immediately of the Blues Brothers You know and Dan Ackroyd comes out I forget what his character was but he says Q we're on a mission from God Q SM And that's what the church is about we're on a mission from God SM H In fact let me clarify it a little more The church has been given a mission but our mission is not for us to go and decide what we're gonna do H our mission is to participate in an to carry out God's mission Because you see God is on a mission God's mission is to build His Kingdom MRC To build the Kingdom of God MRC H To bring the world of lost people into a real and personal love H relationship with him Through faith in His Son Jesus Christ You know what if our vision does not include reaching lost people and caring for lost people H then it's not God's vision Because the Bible is very clear that God cares about lost people
AUD,NA,Yes
DANNY,IL,God loves H people who don't have it all together
AUD,NA,Yes
DANNY,IL,God loves people who are hurting
AUD,NA,Yes
DANNY,IL,God loves people who are suffering Who are seeking And if our vision as Uptown Baptist Church doesn't include In fact if our vision as individual Christians with a relationship with Christ does not include H reaching out and touching the lives of lost hurting dying people H MRC it's not a vision from God MRC H Because God's plan is and has always been to use his people H to carry out His mission And we're gonna see that as we look at Moses TSK H Beginning in the first chapter of Moses I'm not gonna read I am gonna read some of it but I'm not gonna read all the way through because we're gonna try to breeze through the first four chapters H Let's look how God was involved in Moses Or how God involved Moses in His mission Gary one of the things I want us to do uh on building beautiful day is build a taller podium
MANY,NA,LAUGHTER
DANNY,IL,Write that on one of those sheets of paper back there We we need it about right here
MANY,NA,LAUGHTER
DANNY,IL,Oops H Okay TSK H First thing we're gonna see is that MRC God prepares His servants for mission H God prepares his servants for mission MRC As we read in actually as we get to the second chapter we'll see that Uh Moses was not only preserved but he was prepared Uh for his part in God's mission We have to go to chapter one to get a little background Read with me in verse six of chapter one H READ Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died H But the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous H so that the land was filled with them H Then a new king who did not know about Joseph came to power in Egypt Look he said to his people the Israelites have become much too numerous for us Come we must deal shrewdly with them for or they will become even more numerous H and if war breaks out will join our enemies fight against us and leave the country H So they put the slave masters over them to oppress them and f with forced labor H And they built Python and Ramses As store cities For Pharaoh But the more they were oppressed the more they multiplied and spread So the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites And worked them ruthlessly H They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar H And with all kinds of work in the fields H In all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly READ The king or the Pharaoh was a little upset Because the Israelites who were their slaves who were their servants As they took a census they realized that the Israelites numbers were catching up With their own Of the Egyptians And this was upsetting because he saw this as a national threat H From his perspective they w they r you know he just H knew that they were gonna grow to a number and they were gonna outnumber the Egyptians and then they were just gonna take over You know if any H other countries decided to attack H Uh and to to battle uh the Egyptians that he just knew that the Israelites were gonna join them and were gonna overthrow from the inside H So the next part of the chapter he begins to Hx you know first of all he b he works the men very hard He said man if I work these guys hard there not gonna be going home to their wives and there not gonna be H uh H having babies
AUD,NA,
DANNY,IL,You know I guess that was part of his plan That's his first strategy
AUD,NA,
DANNY,IL,so let's make it hard for them Let's really work H work em
AUD,NA,
DANNY,IL,so that they're too tired to go home and and uh
AUD,NA,
DANNY,IL,procreate
MANY,NA,LAUGHTER
DANNY,IL,We'll use that word H But that didn't work Cause they st They continued to
MANY,NA,LAUGHTER
DANNY,IL,They Continued Hx H They continued to d to uh have babies And they continued to multiply
AUD,NA,
DANNY,IL,So he g devises another plan He goes to the midwives You know the Israelites had midwives They didn't have doctors but they had H uh women who when a when one of the Israelite women were gonna have a baby then these midwives just come in and help in the labor process H Or in the birthing process And so he goes to the midwives and says listen Here's what I want you to do you go and you go ahead and you do your part and you help these these mothers H but if they have a boy I want you to make sure that that boy dies If it's a girl you go ahead and let it live And that was his plan Well the midwives you know what could they say this is the the Pharaoh H so they agreed to it but then they didn't do it Because they feared God more than they did Pharaoh H And when uh he calls em he says what's going on They're still multiplying There's still boys being born here
AUD,NA,
DANNY,IL,H what is going on The midwives said well these these mothers they're having the babies without us You know they're not telling us And they're just going ahead and having em They're s H sturdy women
MANY,NA,LAUGHTER
DANNY,IL,It says they don't need us And so Pharaoh comes up with another plan It ends up in the final verse of this chapter H Verse twenty-two READ Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people Every boy that is born must be you must throw into the Nile H But let every girl live READ So he's ordering his people to go And every boy that is born to the Israelites to to kill em Throw em in the river Well Moses was born about this time And this is how God preserved Moses Now Moses's mother loved her child And she didn't want to throw him in I don't think any of the mothers did And she wasn't gonna do it herself H and she was one of these that had the baby without telling anybody except her immediate family H And Moses already when he was born had an older sister and an older brother And the mother now when I was growing up and I heard this story I just assumed that the mother H was hiding the baby in the reeds And that's where she was hiding him But it says for three months she hid the baby H didn't say anything about the the in the river or in the in the uh basket H Uh but then when he was three months old she j she was assuming that she was gonna get caught pretty soon H and so she devised a plan And it doesn't say here that she devised a plan H but believe me This mother knew what she was doing She b she m got a basket She perhaps made the basket Probably did H and then she put what they call pitch or tar H uh on it so that it would float So that water wouldn't come up through it H And she put a blanket put the baby in it wrapped the baby in it H and she told she brought it down to the river Now she didn't just go anywhere in the river H She brought it to a specific place Not just because there were reeds there H but because the Pharaoh's daughter bathed there And this was a selected place H The mother took the baby H put the baby put Moses H in the water And told her sister to keep an eye on it To keep an eye on him so that H nothing bad happened H but also there was an another motive that we'll get to in just a second H So the w so Moses was floating along in the water The Pharaoh's daughter came down to to take her bath Hx And she sees the basket And she sends her servant out to get the basket and bring it to her H And she opens it up there's Moses and he begins to cry H and Pharaoh's daughter felt sorry for Moses And she just decided to keep him It said she realized said this is an Israelite baby H VOX Aw aw poor thing VOX
AUD,NA,
DANNY,IL,H And so she she decides to keep him Well Here's what pha uh Moses's sister did That was her cue H She comes out from hiding and says H Oh whatever your name is H H
MANY,NA,LAUGHTER
DANNY,IL,says oh mighty princess Allow me to get a nurse for the baby I know of an Israelite nurse that can take care of this baby Guess who H SM Her mother SM So she goes and gets the mother H Now Why do I think this is something that the mother knew about Cause it ends up that the mother not only had her child to stay alive H But she also got to take care of him and got paid for it
MANY,NA,LAUGHTER
DANN,NA, So God not only spared his life but He provided uh for for that whole family TSK H But especially for Moses H So we see how God preserved Moses We also see how God prepared Moses H because in the Moses's life is kinda divided into three H stages Each being forty years The first forty years he was in Egypt H The second forty years he was a shepherd H And the third forty years he was leading the people out of Israel And in this first forty years Moses got the best training in the world at that time H His foundational training came from his mother Cause as the nanny and that's what she was at that point even though she was his mother she was his nanny H She trained him in the foundations uh trained him taught him who he was H taught him about his Hebrew origin and the customs of the Israel Israelites Taught him the foundational belief in the true God H taught him of God's promise to Abraham H to multiply his descendants and make a mighty nation of them H Probably the first four or five years the bulk of his time was spent with his mother And he I'm sure she told him that that uh she was his mother his real mother and and about what had happened cause we wouldn't know about it H uh if she didn't But not only did he get this religious training TSK and this foundational belief H in a r in a real God but he also was exposed to the best education that Egypt had to offer Exposed to the wisest teachers and the best culture offered in the world at that time H he learned about the politics and customs of the courts of course this would help him later on when he had to come back and and uh and deal with the courts from a different perspective but that first forty years was spent in being trained And he was trained well And he had great knowledge A lot of knowledge That he was uh that God provided for him through these means And then for the next forty years he was exiled From Egypt Because in order to thinking that because he was an Israelite by birth uh and seeing an Israeli being abused uh he stepped in and he killed the Egyptian that was abusing him H thinking that no one else knew except this person that he had saved H he buried him and then a few days later you know thinking well it's it's all cool nobody knows I'll just go on H He tries to help or tries to intervene between two other uh Hebrew that were arguing amongst themself and and he tries to be a peacemaker and they say H you know who made you judge w what about this you just killed the guy the other day H Uh and he realized that people knew And he realized if these if these men knew H then probably Pharaoh was gonna hear pretty soon and so he left He fled H He ran He went out into the wilderness After a few days of uh walking he comes upon a a scene where these two young ladies are herding their father's sheep H and uh some uh mean guys H who knows I don't remember who it was but anyway they came up and tried to to uh take advantage of the two ladies trying to take care of the sheep H and uh and I I assume they were trying to steal the sheep or trying to steal the women either way uh but Moses intervened and he ran them off And saved their lives and saved their livestock H And so they invited him to come with them to to their home and they told their father what had happened and he invited Moses to stay with them H Moses ends up marrying uh one of the young ladies As Ken shared with us the other day it was a a mixed marriage because these uh this family was Black H So for the next forty years he becomes a sheep herder for his father-in-law Who was a a Midian priest And during that forty years he he g gained some other training First of all he became an outdoorsman He became used to being out in the wilderness And that's gonna be important for him for his final forty years H Another thing he's is the area where he herded the sheep was a a huge area And uh he got to know the terrain He got to know his way around And that was important because he was gonna spend his final forty years H in that same area and it was important that he knew where there H the w waterholes were and and where the dangerous areas were H Uh and so God prepared him H God also has prepared us and is preparing us for h for our part in God's mission God is continually building character And I think this middle forty years for Moses was a was a time where God really built character Cause he no longer had everything he wanted uh at his fingertips H uh he had to learn some things He had to learn He had to H learn how to depend on God ON this God that he had learned about From his mother And God is interested in building character in us as individuals In fact God is more concerned about our character than what we do And how we do it And so a lot of what we experience we get frustrated with but God's purpose is to build character within us And so when we're trying to decide w which we should do or not do something that we're tempted to do H we need to remember that God's more concerned about our character H and we should be obedient to Him because that's how He builds our character I believe that God has created and preserved and prepared Uptown Baptist Church To be involved in His mission To be involved in reaching out to the unloved and the hurting To be an influence to the community of Uptown for the Kingdom of God To be a beacon of light for those who are lost and as our sign says on top to proclaim that Christ died for our sins God has also created and prepared Uptown Baptist Church to be a model for urban church missions to the world And that wasn't our reasoning we didn't set out to do the things we do so that we could be a model H or so that we could get publicity H But God has saw seen fit to use us in that way H And this is not for our pride this is just a reality I'm amazed at how people from all over the world have have come H to the city and they've come to Uptown Baptist Church because they heard about us somewhere else in another country or they read a book uh that talked about Uptown Baptist Church God has crea also created an prepared you and me to be involved in His plan First of all He's called us each to a love relationship with Him Some of us have accepted that call and some are still struggling with it But still He wants to have a love relationship with each person that is in this room He's brought us together from many backgrounds many very different backgrounds to be a family H A family of followers of Christ A family to be involved in God's mission Building the Kingdom of God I was talking to Greg on Friday Greg Gey and he was sharing wi somehow we got in a conversation and he was saying something about he he really needed Hx intellectual stimulation because he tended to be more intellectual H and we were talking about why some people were intellectual and some weren't And God just flashed in my mind And I said Greg You know God created you to be intellectual so that you could relate to others who are intellectuals So that you could share with them on their level H Because God didn't create us for our purpose God created us for His purpose H And that's something we have to keep H in before us God has created us made us like we are Allowed us to experience the things that we have experienced H For his purpose And it's for us to seek Him and to know what His purpose is Papa Joe has been a a very strong influence in this community H Not because of his education his educations came from the streets And as he came to a relationship with Jesus Christ he came from a background that w had survived from the streets TSK H He was an alcoholic Now w how why has God use him He wasn't educated he didn't go through special training it's because God prepared him with the experience of his life H so that he could reach out to other people who are going through the same experience So you can't say well I don't have an education Or I don't I can't speak or I can't do this H You have to know that whatever God has given you Whatever H experience that God has brought you through That He wants to use it To reach people for His Kingdom The second thing I want us to know H from this st story of Moses is that God reveals His mission to His servants ENV SIREN_BEGINS

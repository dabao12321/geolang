MARY,MT,About what
ALICE,MT,About the way they were feeling of them being the only ones cleaning the house and all this other shit H I mean what they don't realize is like shit when Ron gets home from work I wanna spend time with Ron because Ron usually doesn't get home till nine or ten
MARY,MT,Yeah
ALICE,MT,Unlike Tim he has to work for every little dime that he makes You know

ALICE,MT,H what it amounts to is mutual r respect and l like Tim told Ron H he told him he goes um what was it he goes nobody fucks with my lifestyle I feel the exact same way And all those bitches and complaints that he has H they're about my lifestyle
MARY,MT,Mhm
ALICE,MT,And he doesn't realize that
MARY,MT,THROAT
ALICE,MT,And that's what I'm gonna tell him
MARY,MT,TSK Well you know
ALICE,MT,And the only way it's gonna work is if we have respect for one another
MARY,MT,That's right That's right
ALICE,MT,And it doesn't mean H going to our parents and complaining about one another H I'm gonna tell him if you have any complaints you talk to the person that you have the complaint about H I'm also going to suggest MRC weekly house meetings MRC to discuss such things
MARY,MT,Mhm TSK Oh yeah Yeah You know what it would be a real good lesson for them too in self assertiveness
ALICE,MT,Yep
MARY,MT,you know and especially the way um I mean Tim gets in himself into a uncomfortable situation or whatever H and his first reaction is to blow up about it
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,You know cause he let he lets it pile up
ALICE,MT,Yep
MARY,MT,He doesn't do nothing positive about it and then he just blows up

MARY,MT,Oh shit really I didn't hear about it
ALICE,MT,Yeah Ron was singlehandedly there with one wrecker
MARY,MT,G yeah
ALICE,MT,THROAT
MARY,MT,Seems like any time I've seen a wrecker out here there's always two guys in there
ALICE,MT,Hm-m X everyone was gone when the call came in
MARY,MT,Oh
ALICE,MT,And Jay's not supposed to go on those anymore because of his heart H TSK so he had to send Ron by himself and Ron was slowly pulling everybody out of the ditch
MARY,MT,Did they all hit each other Or just
ALICE,MT,Kind of A a semi bumped a car and then went and went on two wheels and just about lost it and then TSK got back up on all all its wheels again
MARY,MT,Oh Did it land in the ditch
ALICE,MT,But it Hx Kind of it was able to get out H but all the other cars that were in the direct vicinity all hit the ditch And then there was three cars and the semi H And then this uh this guy pulled up and

MARY,MT,Man that's pretty bad
ALICE,MT,I know Darn this darn dog keeps breathing X and like X dreaming X you know X I wonder if we should wake her up
MARY,MT,No she'll get scared and want to go outside Kinda nervous you know
ALICE,MT,They say you can really mess up a dog by waking em up when they're dreaming
MARY,MT,Really
ALICE,MT,Mhm It's so cold outside but yet sometimes she insists on staying out there
MARY,MT,I know You know what I was thinking of doing
ALICE,MT,Hunh
MARY,MT,I don't know she's kind of shy but I was wondering
ALICE,MT,SNEEZE
MARY,MT,what it would be like to train her
ALICE,MT,SNIFF
MARY,MT,to pull a sled
ALICE,MT,I don't know if she'd do it
MARY,MT,I don't know if she would either She's kind of timid
ALICE,MT,Mhm She doesn't trust too many people at all
MARY,MT,Yeah
ALICE,MT,SNIFF SWALLOW Oh and you know another thing that Tim had the audacity to bitch about
MARY,MT,What
ALICE,MT,He said um Mandy had to stay up all by herself and decorate the tree until four in the morning And I even asked if we could put our ornaments on there and they told me X that X there wouldn't be enough room
MARY,MT,Really
ALICE,MT,Mhm Tim said that
MARY,MT,TSK H She was probably lonely when she was doing it you know that She probably was X
ALICE,MT,I sat up with her and I was talking to her she was doing all the decorating I mean H what was I gonna do She I mean she was just putting up the balls and everything and H she'd say Q where where do you think this should go Q and so I was sitting there doing my Welfare application And uh you know I was just sitting there watching her telling her H where to put everything and what not
MARY,MT,Did you know Nickie wanted her own tree
ALICE,MT,Yes
MARY,MT,And I forgot to bring it in it's outside
ALICE,MT,What are you gonna do with it
MARY,MT,She wants to set it up for her Barbies I was just gonna use a tin can and put rocks in the bottom
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,And just stick it in there SWALLOW TSK H And you know what I did
ALICE,MT,Hm
MARY,MT,I didn't want to waste a tree's life
ALICE,MT,TSK
MARY,MT,so I just cut a branch off one H God X I fell up there X DRINK
ALICE,MT,Where'd you go to get em
MARY,MT,You know where Sarah and Arvela live
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,Just around the corner Remember that first cattle guard you go over
ALICE,MT,Unhunh
MARY,MT,I didn't even go over that
ALICE,MT,You mean kinda like by the by the tunnel
MARY,MT,Right below the tunnel
ALICE,MT,Oh
MARY,MT,And I just walked up We just walked up around uh that area H God Alice that was fun
ALICE,MT,H Did you get grandma a tree too
MARY,MT,Hunh-unh
ALICE,MT,Does she already have one
MARY,MT,Hm-m TSK That pickup could only hold like three
ALICE,MT,Mm I wonder why Did daddy say to take the pickup back Or what was the deal
MARY,MT,Yeah Yeah
ALICE,MT,Why
MARY,MT,Cause Phoebe needs it
ALICE,MT,What's wrong with the car H
MARY,MT,Oh you didn't hear about it
ALICE,MT,Hunh-unh
MARY,MT,Oh you did about how the engine was on fire
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,See there was oil spilling out leaking out from the valve cover
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,The valve cover gasket apparently cracked or whatever and there was oil coming out H and the oil got hot and you know how it gets hot and smokes
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,Well I guess enough came out because we were losing oil bad going from Billings to Crow um there's a lot of
ALICE,MT,DRINK
MARY,MT,smoke coming out and by the time we got to Hardin we had to put like uh three or four quarts in
ALICE,MT,Unhunh
MARY,MT,It was three H And Hx by the time we got to
ALICE,MT,H
MARY,MT,Crow it was it was one quart low And there was smoke still coming from under the engine I figure w if it was losing that much oil H then X it X caught fire
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,Cause the engine was hot cause there wasn't enough water in the radiator
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,TSK I talked to Oscar about it and he said H well I checked it was only it was only about I'd say a half a quart to a quart short of water But that shouldn't make any difference He goes the only thing I can think of H is that there was an air lock in there
ALICE,MT,THROAT
MARY,MT,And that running the engine out on the open road
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,Caused that air lock to come through flushed it out
ALICE,MT,And bust the gasket
MARY,MT,No it would more or less um the engine wasn't being kept cool enough Cause there wasn't enough fluid in the radiator
ALICE,MT,DRINK Unhunh
MARY,MT,And you know how the radiator's the pipe's close to other parts of the engine
ALICE,MT,Yeah So what
MARY,MT,It was some part in there
ALICE,MT,caused the fire
MARY,MT,The engine being too hot and the oil leaking
ALICE,MT,So he knew that the oil was leaking
MARY,MT,No TSK we knew we were losing oil but we didn't know where I just figured it was from that valve cover gasket Just from lifting up the hood and looking at it
ALICE,MT,H So what's he gonna do
MARY,MT,Well and two of his wires the sparkplug wires
ALICE,MT,Unhunh
MARY,MT,were fried all the way through
ALICE,MT,Unhunh
MARY,MT,So we took those off and we replaced them with some old ones out of the garage
ALICE,MT,I knew that
MARY,MT,And it runs It runs There's enough uh radiator fluid in there
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,so that it will It's it's enough
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,DRINK But I think running it out on the open road will cause it possibly to shoot more oil out
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,That valve cover gasket has to be replaced
ALICE,MT,Hm Hx
MARY,MT,I don't know H Oh I freaked Cookie and Rita and Gary out tonight Remember the Plain Plainfeather uh Claypit where that red clay is
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,Right there I saw my my speedometer just go Brr like that just down H You know and I knew exactly what it was What I have to do is take off the distributor wire and splice it in with the fuel pump wire
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,Because my fuel pump is now electric Never used to be
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,Hand me that ashtray Or your light I mean P Your light P H It's behind the sewing machine H
ALICE,MT,THROAT
MARY,MT,And uh sometimes it gets loose
ALICE,MT,YAWN
MARY,MT,And no more HI fuel HI
ALICE,MT,YAWN Unhunh
MARY,MT,So I stopped the car and they said what are you doing I said Q oh I gotta tighten this wire here Q H So I had Cookie turn on the ignition and turn it off So cause see once you turn that key on then you hear the the fuel pump come on
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,And if the wire's not connected right it doesn't come on
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,So I did that and I lit a match to find out where I was and n after everything was hunky-dory then I shut the hood and got back in and I started up the engine and H both Gary and Rita were sitting on the edges of their seat SWALLOW And I turned around and I looked and I said Q did I scare you kids Q H They wouldn't say anything then Gary goes H Q yeah I was scared Q
ALICE,MT,H
MARY,MT,H
ALIC,MT, Hx Mary X But X I freaked em out I don't know Then daddy said something about the steering column on my car needing MATCH_STRIKE_work
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,Said long as I don't drive it fast it should be alright But oh man I don't know See the thing about it is if I go after Ken I'm not really gonna have any money
ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,to um you know HI do things HI SWALLOW I'm not saying I'm gonna TSK pay for everything but I don't want to be broke around him H
ALICE,MT,I know that really sucks
MARY,MT,TSK Cause I wanna at least be able to put gas in the car
ALICE,MT,SWALLOW Mhm
MARY,MT,and go do something
ALICE,MT,H I don't think it's such a good idea for you to go up there in the winter

ALICE,MT,SWALLOW We should all get some money together and is there any way he could like
MARY,MT,H
ALICE,MT,meet us in Great Falls or something Cause I'd like to go up there and go to the um H Red Lobster

ALICE,MT,Hx Mhm
MARY,MT,H I remember I was pregnant with Nicky SWALLOW And uh Boots's little boy he really liked me

ALICE,MT,Mhm
MARY,MT,And he'd fall asleep with me And I remember he would I woke up and here he was gone his mother carried him in the other room
ALICE,MT,Mhm

ALICE,MT,H Was Would um Was Nicky mad when Trace was a boy
MARY,MT,Kind of H She thinks I should have twins Twin girls
ALICE,MT,COUGH COUGH

ALICE,MT,Hx
MARY,MT,But I don't know she's six years old now And they say that if there's six years between children there's not that much rivalry
ALICE,MT,After four there's almost none

WOOD B,NA,t this is very important Because new ideas come up because it's kinky And it's just wonderful the marvelous new ideas that come up H And of course what I like about America because in spite of being very international in my feeling H I think ours is a wonderful country H We're quick in friendship We are open to new ideas H We made we presented many new inventions But and this is very serious H Our um TSK H uh athletes H our actors are getting millions H And our teachers are being cut down H And our libraries are being closed MRC This is very very serious MRC H it's putting a block on knowledge H China and other Middle East country Not H other Middle East but Middle East countries and China H and other countries H are realizing the importance of education H And going after it H And we are cutting down In that direction H And it worries me a great deal H Now TSK H One of the wonders of America TSK however H TSK in spite of the bad things H several years ago Tony Prieto H uh who taught ceramics I think at Mills College he and his wife H went to Europe To learn And we he rela turned he said H MRC Europe shares nothing MRC America shares H And because America shares our craft movement H Has grown so wonderfully H We're doing wonderfully inventive things in craft H Uh I have been very fortunate myself I'm not naturally a craftsman H but I've had four very wonderful craftsmen H to help me H uh Lukens at USC H the Natzlers Otto and Gertrud Natzler great potters H when they first came to America Gertrud Natzler H would sit by me at the wheel H and help me try H to see what throwing was about H then my colleagues in Ojai Vivika and Otto Heino H they've been so generous they're teachers H they pass down everything they've helped me H and uh I remember Toshiko H Takaezu her name's so hard for me to say H was visiting me H she spent a day and a half helping me H center on the wheel H MRC All this sharing MRC H In our schools Amongst craftsman themselves H Is a wonderful thing H So the movements go on H And of course our museums Are so important H I don't know if military minded people PAR hope nobody from the FBI is here PAR MANY LAUGHTER
WOOD I,NA, our military people if uh realize the importance of museums H MRC museums protect all the great art MRC H The great invention H The creative efforts of man from the beginning of time H And they're our inspiration H and I think our museums are doing wonderfully now even though H we're beginning to cut down on education H I uh I feel about the importance H of craft Of bringing beauty Craft into life TSK H One day I said to Vivika Heino Because I'm a snob about art Ever since a child I've been dragged H through the museums of Europe and America and my eyes are exposed to H great art H So I said VOX you know VOX it's a mistake to teach cr pottery in high school The students haven't time to make anything beautiful and important And Vivika Heino so wisely answered H that is not the purpose H It opens them To aesthetics H And that's what right education does H Now H I wonder We have a tremendous population in prison And it's growing we can hardly house them Why We put the cart before the horse We put people in prison Why Because they have MRC not had right education MRC in the beginning H And right education is the basis H of everything H Now ha I'll end with one other H idea and then you can ask me questions and that is this H Since there is an Olympic of athletes H Why not have an Olympic of ethnic and tribal dancers H from countries all over the world H Then people could come H and meet they'd have beautiful costumes H friendships would be made H and I don't think we can have peace just with guns H Peace comes through friendship H And friendships would be made H with all these dancers intermingling H And even dancing with each other Because when you touch you don't shoot MANY LAUGHTER APPLAUSE
WOOD,NY,And I base this on a little experience of my own H when I was in H uh uh Ojai As a sweet young thing H I would go dancing at the art center I knew all kinds of square dancing folk dancing H nobody cared who we were dancing with if it was the rich rancher H or H a man taking care of trash nobody cared H As long as he was a good dancer H And after
PERROT,NA,
WOOD,NY,every month H we had a party And all of us H mixed together in friendship H That is wonderful H And something like this could happen H If we had great dances H So I come back my last word is violence never ends with violence And right education is the basis of everything MANY APPLAUSE

WOOD I,NA,think it'd be wonderful Uh I've always been concerned about people being H in prison H but I really don't know very much I just think it's a terrible thing That we have so many in prison And I'm sure we could s what is called save the lives of endless people if they had a creative outlet H But what is a young person to do H Brought up not knowing in any way right from wrong no compassion H seeing bing bing bing H guns used all the time no money H drugs why should they not steal H Now I don't know if this has any value it's personal TSK H When I left home I made a very unhappy marriage in name only H But the man it was a disaster And I was for quite a few years H MRC without any money MRC And I mean H I sold w my own books H to get money to eat I know what it is H to be at zero I was not trained for the world H I didn't know how to relate H to the world H But uh once a week I always went back to see my parents H and they never said anything They never blamed me From that time on H My mother said she always had a very good H uh luncheon for me H Suspecting that I was hungry And I was H One day she said H go up to my room H and get some information out of my purse H I went there I opened her purse it was full of money MANY LAUGHTER

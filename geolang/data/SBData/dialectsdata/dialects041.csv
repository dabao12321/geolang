KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Well let's kind of figure out a classic um diet uh quota for you H And let me get a piece of paper so that we can write that down ENV DESK_DRAWER
PAIGE,NA,SNIFF
KRISTIN,OH/CA,The way we do this
PAIGE,NA,Yeah
KRISTIN,OH/CA,is first of all we make a a guesstimate of how many calories typically H that you would need D we we didn't do this last time did we
PAIGE,NA,Hm-m
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Okay H Alright Yeah I think we were gonna wait until we cause you were gonna change some things maybe after you saw Doris So H first of all we make a good guesstimate Of how many calories you need And that's always a tough one Um
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,most women H unless you work out a lot You probably aren't burning much more than like eighteen hundred H to maybe two thousand calories
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H So Hx what we can do Hx um TSK I would say I'm gonna go ahead and make it out about eighteen hundred Just because uh you're at a good weight you're about five five H um TSK I think that would be a prudent place to to start out from I know I won't uh cause you to gain weight and you probably won't lose any either But uh
PAIGE,NA,
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Okay So we're gonna take eighteen hundred calories
PAIGE,NA,SNIFF Uh h- How um how many calories do you think I'm eating now or can you even tell that
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK H
PAIGE,NA,from looking
KRISTIN,OH/CA,I could do a calorie count um on that but I'd actually need more amounts
PAIGE,NA,H Although you wouldn't be able to tell because there's no I don't write down like the fats and things like that
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Well if if you gave me real specific amounts Like I had you know one quarter cup of soy milk half a cup of cereal
PAIGE,NA,Yeah
KRISTIN,OH/CA,then I could
PAIGE,NA,Oh okay
KRISTIN,OH/CA,I could count your calories
PAIGE,NA,I see SNIFF
KRISTIN,OH/CA,and and figure that out And run it through the computer And get a printout
PAIGE,NA,Mm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H
PAIGE,NA,Hm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Of your nutrient ratio and everything
PAIGE,NA,Wow
KRISTIN,OH/CA,For the day In fact if you wanna do that I'd be glad to run it for you But you'd have to take one day
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,And really
PAIGE,NA,And write everything down Yeah
KRISTIN,OH/CA,be
PAIGE,NA,H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,like precise
PAIGE,NA,Okay
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Um H okay So eighteen hundred calories times point four that's gonna be forty H calories or excuse me Um forty percent of your calories coming from carbo hydrate And that's Doris's standard H protocol really
PAIGE,NA,Mm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK Okay times point four H gives us seven hundred and twenty carbohydrate calories
PAIGE,NA,H Yeah
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK Then we divide that by four
PAIGE,NA,H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Calories per gram You've
PAIGE,NA,H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,I know you've seen this before H Which gives us a quota of a hundred and eighty grams of carbohydrate per day Actually I should've done that
PAIGE,NA,Mm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Okay Then we have to distribute it
PAIGE,NA,Wow That's low
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK TSK Yeah
PAIGE,NA,That's not that much
KRISTIN,OH/CA,It is
PAIGE,NA,H 
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Then we have to distribute that into a an ideal ratio Now you always do have breakfast Really Unless you're running H a bit on the higher side
PAIGE,NA,Really high Yeah
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK And you always have some kinda lunch pretty much H and you always have some kind of dinner
PAIGE,NA,Well yeah
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Basically
PAIGE,NA,H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Now the mid-morning snack the snacks are hit and miss That's where we maybe would h have to to look at things A little bit more closely H But usually lunch and dinner are your main meals H And we would give you about a thirty percent quota at both lunch and dinner which is H about fifty four grams at each of those places
PAIGE,NA,Hm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Would be sort of your ballpark quota H And it's not outlandish Like here you were sixty-four well a little bit higher Um
PAIGE,NA,Mm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK H Here well you were about uh forty fifty-nine sixty-four H So sixty-four fifty that was seventy-four So it's a little bit higher Is what you're used to doing
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H And um TSK
PAIGE,NA,H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Yes
PAIGE,NA,Yeah I remember Hx Like Hx a long long time ago Let's see uh it was H I guess forty Hx maybe forty forty-five seventy Or something
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK Okay
PAIGE,NA,That's how they had it divided up
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Okay
PAIGE,NA,I think Although H that's m more Right Let's see H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,T_sounds pretty high
PAIGE,NA,That's Yeah
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Yeah
PAIGE,NA,That's what A total of a hundred and
KRISTIN,OH/CA,It might've been based either on a higher calorie level
PAIGE,NA,SNIFF
KRISTIN,OH/CA,or H a higher percent of your calories coming from carbos
PAIGE,NA,Mhm Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Like if this were fifty percent
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Which is probably more realistic for how you eat
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Being a vegetarian you eat more And we can change it up H But we'll use this as a base And then we wanna compare it
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,to what you H typically do and the thing is if you started doing this right now you'd have low blood sugars
PAIGE,NA,Right
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Cause you've already adjusted your insulin
PAIGE,NA,Yeah
KRISTIN,OH/CA,to another level
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK H But I think what you could learn from this is that um at least if you sort of chose a standard H place for a while
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Until you got things a little more stabilized it might be easier to do your insulin
PAIGE,NA,Mhm Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H And then um once you y are a little more comfortable with that then you can start doing this flux with
PAIGE,NA,Right
KRISTIN,OH/CA,adding the unit for another ten grams Say if you usually have sixty-four H and you find you know ex units of insulin works for that
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK well then you can jockey it from there H Now at breakfast we often keep that down around twelve H because
PAIGE,NA,Twelve Wow
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Uh percent Uh
PAIGE,NA,Oh H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,point one two times
PAIGE,NA,I thought you meant grams I was gonna say h where do you find H food that's that low
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Well
PAIGE,NA,H H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,some people actually Hx end up having to do that H That's only about twenty-two grams
PAIGE,NA,Zero or something SNIFF
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Because of that dawn phenomenon
PAIGE,NA,Mm Mm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK So that's not much at all H Then
PAIGE,NA,Yeah like even an English muffin is too much
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Unhunh Unhunh
PAIGE,NA,Even oatmeal
KRISTIN,OH/CA,It's it's really difficult you can either have either or sort of a thing H Let's see sixty seventy-two H okay So that gives us a twenty-eight to distribute throughout the rest of the day H And Hx um making a decision of how to do that really involves your insulins Now in the morning H you've got a good amount Of regular insulin that you take
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,So I would wanna put a little bit higher percentage H for your snack there Like
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,I would say maybe even ten percent here Um H
PAIGE,NA,TSK H See I hate that snack Having to eat snacks
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK Oh
PAIGE,NA,I just don't have time
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H
PAIGE,NA,You know
KRISTIN,OH/CA,The only Hx trouble with that is
PAIGE,NA,Hx
KRISTIN,OH/CA,at breakfast you MRC just won't have MRC your insulins there for you H to eat the big carbo breakfast typically
PAIGE,NA,Mm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Unless you run high after breakfast And then it comes down H when the insulins finally do get working
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H But then you're running high
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,And that's you know that's the only way to protect yourself
PAIGE,NA,Right
KRISTIN,OH/CA,is yeah you eat a bunch of carbo you take a bunch of insulin H you run high for an hour and a half
PAIGE,NA,Right
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H and then all of a sudden it comes skyrocketing down
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H When all the insulins get on board
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,So um TSK H
PAIGE,NA,Right
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Anyway Uh point one TSK okay that's just gonna be eighteen H
PAIGE,NA,H I wonder how
KRISTIN,OH/CA,roughly there
PAIGE,NA,Hx How does Doris do that though Because she like I don't think she eats lunch or anything I mean
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK H
PAIGE,NA,she just like Hx H has this really minimal dose of NPH I think
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK H You'd have to ask her
PAIGE,NA,H That's what uh
KRISTIN,OH/CA,I don't know
PAIGE,NA,That's what I suspect H H Hx H H H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H I don't know the trade secrets there H Um H but uh h you know I think H probably um TSK H keeping the carbos a little on the lower side enable Of course then you'd need less insulin which makes life easier
PAIGE,NA,Mhm Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,It does make it easier if you do eat less carbo Cause you don't have to take these big H amounts and then wonder what they're gonna do and when
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Um this actually sometimes makes it more complicated TSK Now H mid afternoon you are taking a touch of regular at lunch but you don't really eat much of a snack Usually After lunch Cause you have a late lunch might have some Cheetos there I see
PAIGE,NA,Mhm Oh that was just cause I was like
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Um
PAIGE,NA,couldn't eat dinner Hx
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Cashews
PAIGE,NA,Hm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Um
PAIGE,NA,H Hx
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK
PAIGE,NA,H I had to go to something like right at at six o'clock or seven o'clock or something
KRISTIN,OH/CA,So that really may be one
PAIGE,NA,H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,where it's sort of debatable You know maybe at the most you'd have five percent there Um and I'm just sort of guessing as a place to start uh why'd I do that I knew what it was H And that's just hardly anything That's a f Some a few nuts Really And that's about it or um H then later on you do sometimes eat after dinner Cause you're kind of a nightowl and um
PAIGE,NA,H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK let's see this'll go twenty-two plus H uh so we're looking at about roughly thirteen fifteen percent there H so okay so approximately well s essentially like breakfast THROAT TSK So H those would just be places to start from PAPER_TEAR But I think um what's even more important
PAIGE,NA,Okay
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H is you've gotta tailor it to what your insulin is And use these as a jumping off place You know if you say well this is ridiculous I always have a seventy H carbo dinner
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,well so what You know there's nothing wrong with that it just means H you slightly adjust that insulin Same thing if you H don't like snacks what are you gonna do to compensate
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,for the fact H that there's there's a lotta insulin there maybe And um
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,how are you gonna get around that H Um TSK but that's the sole purpose of snacks is to really prevent H lows from happening and to counteract um the insulin time actions H Um TSK H So Hx
PAIGE,NA,Hm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,M
PAIGE,NA,TSK H Oh
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Maybe we should compare
PAIGE,NA,
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Go ahead
PAIGE,NA,H Oh I just had one question so for example
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Unhunh
PAIGE,NA,say I didn't eat lunch H Then what would happen Like then I could not take the insulin there
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H
PAIGE,NA,And then
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Well
PAIGE,NA,But then I don't know
KRISTIN,OH/CA,you probably would need to eat a little something
PAIGE,NA,I wonder I would get high then maybe hunh H Hx
KRISTIN,OH/CA,because of your NPH peaking
PAIGE,NA,Mhm Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,although H you don't take a lot of NPH So
PAIGE,NA,In the morning yeah
KRISTIN,OH/CA,It may be debatable if you really need to have something H later in the af uh or b to get you into dinner okay Um TSK
PAIGE,NA,Hmm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,You know you might have to eat sort of an afternoon snack if you don't
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Um or yeah Take look at look at the NPH that you're taking and y Doris could help you with that H Did she give you a scale for a w no lunch lunch scale
PAIGE,NA,H A w while ago but um it changed after that See this was the original thing H That I had She said but Okay this was Hx hm TSK H This was a while ago Hx See three twenty-four ninety-four So H um TSK like for example she had these two things so if I was gonna eat like say I H I decided ok in the morning I was gonna eat lunch H Then I would take four units of NPH and then supplement it with the regular H but if I knew like say in the morning That I wasn't gonna eat lunch Then
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Hm
PAIGE,NA,she said take But this doesn't make any sense To me Take six NPH cause I would be low with this then definitely
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK H
PAIGE,NA,You know
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Yeah
PAIGE,NA,In in the afternoon
KRISTIN,OH/CA,hunh Okay H Yeah
PAIGE,NA,THROAT I think this was kinda guessing
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Well
PAIGE,NA,too Cause H it was before
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Hm
PAIGE,NA,I had really
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Yeah H Definitely um you know check with her on your insulins Cause you know she is the only one that can really clarify them Um TSK you know just H it's tough To H to do H the jockeying of of the food and the insulin It really um TSK H
PAIGE,NA,Mm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,It it just it makes it really um a a challenge there to
PAIGE,NA,H Well this is where I got the idea that she d Probably doesn't eat lunch Well Hx I don't know how she would have time anyway Every time you see her it's like H you know five minutes here five minutes there but um H then also just like um I don't know She sort of like knew what I meant when I was saying
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Unhunh Unhunh
PAIGE,NA,oh it's such a pain to have to H  stop and eat lunch
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Mhm
PAIGE,NA,You know H And so um that's where I got that idea But
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Mm H Mhm H Well it's Yeah Let's see And so four of N six of N and then zero regular there
PAIGE,NA,TSK Yeah
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Hm H That's where just monitoring monitoring monitoring Um
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,lets you know if if it's gonna work for you or not If it's too strong or not strong enough
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Um TSK H yeah Yeah
PAIGE,NA,Right
KRISTIN,OH/CA,So it's H Well anyway how can I How can I help you with all this
PAIGE,NA,Hx
KRISTIN,OH/CA,I feel like uh we're still in a pickle H in that um it's just every day is so different
PAIGE,NA,
KRISTIN,OH/CA,and H
PAIGE,NA,H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,you know you're you're adjusting your insulins
PAIGE,NA,Right
KRISTIN,OH/CA,uh per your uh protocols that you have there H and the carbos are varying around that um TSK but you know I think it's important we make some kind of a a goal to prevent these lows from happening
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H and uh try and prevent the ones that are creeping up a little bit too high H And you know what do you think um TSK that uh H you could do to h clarify this a little bit more and
PAIGE,NA,H Oh
KRISTIN,OH/CA,make it a little easier H
PAIGE,NA,TSK H Well I guess maybe if I try this M maybe that's the only way H Cause it seems like to me that um TSK H P I don't know P I don't know It's Maybe it's easier if I have like some kind of set thing cause then H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Yeah Something to shoot for
PAIGE,NA, Yeah
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Kinda 
PAIGE,NA,Cause otherwise I'll just do whatever I feel like doing
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Right
PAIGE,NA,you know H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Right
PAIGE,NA, H H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Uh
PAIGE,NA,Obviously H H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,X TSK H Well you you could give this a try as far as the levels but what I would do is is use what you're currently doing as sort of a backup guide H Because obviously if you're having and and this has changed A lot Uh over the past few days But um TSK H well one day you have thirty-eight at breakfast The next day you have none H Um
PAIGE,NA,TSK H Yeah but that's like if it's high
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK Forty
PAIGE,NA,H And it also like sometimes I just write em in different columns Cause
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Okay
PAIGE,NA,Cause uh depending on what time it was
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H But if you're having only you know Around and what you could do is sort of round these A little bit Like shoot for say twenty-five or
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H just say every morning you're gonna have a thirty
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,like a thirty gram carbohydrate brekfast Period
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H That's um it it would work And then you just start learning from that
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,You know you know that a thirty gram carbohydrate breakfast would be an improvement H on what you were doing as far as dropping it down a little bit
PAIGE,NA,Mhm Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H and yet it would be s it would also be something kind of easy to do with toast or bread
PAIGE,NA,Right Right
KRISTIN,OH/CA,or English muffins H so you could just lock into that And uh see see how that goes Um H uh mid morning well that's kind of a debatable one cause you don't really like to have the snack
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H but try it And see Maybe carry something with you And it could be something simple You might make this just sort of a H a plastic baggie full of crackers That you take with you wherever you go
PAIGE,NA,Mhm Right
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H and just make it a standard habit
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Or it could be a piece of fruit H That is gonna be approximately in that ballpark TSK And H lunchtime I I would say maybe rounding it I might round it to sixty H So so what if we increase your quota up to about forty-five percent
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,It's not a big deal That that's not the most important thing The main thing is that you're trying to hit those quotas consistently
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Um TSK here I don't think you'll have any problem eating something later on after dinner
PAIGE,NA,H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H if anything it's it's gonna be trying to maybe keep this down
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Around fifteen to thirty or something in that ballpark
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H But I agree that if you can make it a little more rock steady H you should be able to smooth some of these things out a bit more if you have a schedule that you're trying
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H to to go for TSK But these are a little bit more scientifically H derived
PAIGE,NA,Yeah Mhm Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,based on what insulins are doing a a and when
PAIGE,NA,Right
KRISTIN,OH/CA,So
PAIGE,NA,TSK H Yeah Hm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Questions Uh Hx
PAIGE,NA,No I'm just I was just looking at this number and thinking H BR Oh BR if I only eat that Hx amount of carbohydrate at dinner
KRISTIN,OH/CA,
PAIGE,NA,I'll be just like dropping %
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H
PAIGE,NA,You know All night long
KRISTIN,OH/CA,With your
PAIGE,NA,And and that is so annoying It's like you have to keep eating and keep eating Cause I've had that happen H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,Well maybe realistically what you wanna do is keep this one because lunch well what are you gonna have really You're gonna have yeah A couple tortillas or maybe a sandwich or something along that line
PAIGE,NA,Yeah
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Maybe realistically this is only about forty or fiftyish
PAIGE,NA,Yeah
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H Okay So that's fine I would just adjust this to fifty or forty-five or whatever you see fit
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H But dinner you're right You have control in that you have a regular sliding scale that you can use TSK and maybe b realistically you should make this H seventy
PAIGE,NA,Mhm Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,And just but but call it seventy and then really try H to stand by that And look at the insulin look at your numbers before and after H and what does happen over the course of the evening H Um do you have to go ahead and have this within two hours Or
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,H uh or what H
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,But but look at it and see but stand by it Make it like seventy and then just stick to it
PAIGE,NA,Mhm
KRISTIN,OH/CA,TSK Um
PAIGE,NA,SNIFF Okay
KRISTIN,OH/CA,So H
PAIGE,NA,Okay H
KRISTIN,OH/CA,So anyway That's something you could play with for uh a little while and see if if it um helps H in getting rid of some of the outliers That we're trying to fix up So H um other questions Uh

JAMIE,CA,How can you teach a three-year-old to tap dance
HAROLD,NA,I can't imagine teaching a @Yeah really
JAMIE,CA,H
MILES,NA,Who suggested this to em
HAROLD,NA,I have no idea It was probably my sister-in-law's idea because I think they saw that movie
JAMIE,CA,Tap X X
HAROLD,NA,What was the
MILES,NA,<X They had X>
HAROLD,NA,the movie with that really hot tap dancer
JAMIE,CA,Oh that kid
MILES,NA,He was actually here two weeks ago and I missed him
JAMIE,CA,at the at the jazz tap thing or whatever
HAROLD,NA,Was he a little kid
MILES,NA,No he's sixteen now
JAMIE,CA,H No he's like Yeah he's a teenager but he teaches these classes in New York
MILES,NA,X That X boy he's supposed to be awesome
JAMIE,CA,Yeah Really fast
PETE,CA,Hm
HAROLD,NA,But I'm sure that was the the impetus
MILES,NA,Have you seen him
JAMIE,CA,No I just read an article on him
MILES,NA,You you probably read the same Examiner article I read
JAMIE,CA,Yeah probably yeah
MILES,NA,talking about how Gregory Hines said he doesn't realize a human being can't tap that fast
JAMIE,CA,Right Right
PETE,CA,
JAMIE,CA,Yeah
MILES,NA,And they were talking about how he's teaching these classes
PETE,CA,Hm
MILES,NA,and I guess he really goes fast X And X
JAMIE,CA,Yeah
MILES,NA,H he k
JAMIE,CA,He doesn't explain anything precisely
MILES,NA,He has to double it down to like one fifth speed or something before they can g pick it up
HAROLD,NA,Well I'm sure Thomas is all over it
JAMIE,CA,Probably XX XXX
HAROLD,NA,I mean he has a bro-
MILES,NA,XXXX could have seen him
HAROLD,NA,I guess that means his broken leg is @doing okay
PETE,CA,I was wondering about that I was imagining he had broke an arm or something
JAMIE,CA,<HI Oh yeah HI>
PETE,CA,But it was his leg
HAROLD,NA,Yeah
PETE,CA,That's like X I guess X that he was being hauled around in a little wagon and stuff
HAROLD,NA,Right He healed very quickly
JAMIE,CA,<X Guess X kids bones just like grow back really fast Hx
PETE,CA,Mhm
HAROLD,NA,Yeah I think they're really soft to start with
JAMIE,CA,They're made of rubber Th that's it
HAROLD,NA,That's why b little kids usually don't break their legs anyway
PETE,CA,Cause they're so XXXX
JAMIE,CA,Cause they're made of rubber
MILES,NA,But they have more cartilage than w you know
HAROLD,NA,Yeah aren't they real s aren't their k legs pretty soft
MILES,NA,Yeah there's less calcium deposits X in them X And also
PETE,CA,Mm
MILES,NA,they're still growing And the way bones grow is you make cartilage and then you deposit calcium in it
HAROLD,NA,Oh and then that turns into hard bone
MILES,NA,So that's why they always have more flexibility Cause as they're growing
PETE,CA,Hm
MILES,NA,you're making cartilage So it al
PETE,CA,Mhm
MILES,NA,They always have that until they reach adulthood in which case
HAROLD,NA,They get old and cranky like the rest of us
MILES,NA,it stops

JAMIE,CA,
PETE,CA,cause I think Indo Indonesians
JAMIE,CA,think H
PETE,CA,or people who've been to Indonesia think that those guys like the two top ones have really European characteristics compared to Indonesians
JAMIE,CA,Uh
PETE,CA,Just cause their eyes are real big and their noses are big
HAROLD,NA,Their eyes are round
JAMIE,CA,Oh really
PETE,CA,And Indonesians have real thin eyes and and flat noses and stuff P I don't know P
HAROLD,NA,Except those well I don't know the the bottom ones don't have flat noses either
PETE,CA,That's X true X they all have b they all have big noses But they get bigger as you go up anyway

HAROLD,NA,Oba Oba
MILES,NA,
PETE,CA,m_yeah
JAMIE,CA,Gross
PETE,CA,Mm
MILES,NA,But I'm sure those guys get a lot of attention from women They travel all over the world I'm sure a lot of women throw themselves at em so that's what they expect from women
HAROLD,NA,A lot of groupies
MILES,NA,Yeah Fringe benefits
PETE,CA,Hm
MILES,NA,H
JAMIE,CA,The only fringe benefit X of X being a dancer probably
HAROLD,NA,Well in San Francisco

HAROLD,NA,you never know if it's a benefit or not either
JAMIE,CA,That's true

MILES,NA,I didn't know this but apparently in Brazil they have a very very high AIDS infection rate
HAROLD,NA,Really
JAMIE,CA,Oh
PETE,CA,Oh
JAMIE,CA,probably X
MILES,NA,It's supposed to be very high

JAMIE,CA,Very unmonitored
HAROLD,NA,higher than the United State-
JAMIE,CA,too
HAROLD,NA,Higher than around here
MILES,NA,SNIFF That's what I've heard
PETE,CA,Hm
JAMIE,CA,P I wouldn't be surprised P
HAROLD,NA,Have you heard these figures that like um it's something like forty percent of males in the Bay Area are supposed to be infected ENV MUSIC_STOPS
MILES,NA,Well last July
PETE,CA,Oh really
MILES,NA,this is what
JAMIE,CA,Of homosexual males or of males
PETE,CA,Of all males
HAROLD,NA,Of males in general
MILES,NA,This infectious disease woman
HAROLD,NA,Or males under thirty I think it is
MILES,NA,at San Francisco General
PETE,CA,Mhm
MILES,NA,she said that this doesn't seem like it can be true but she said that ninety per cent of gay men are HIV positive and fifty percent of all males are HIV positive
HAROLD,NA,Yeah
MILES,NA,That's what she said
HAROLD,NA,Fifty perc It was some Like a m half or more than half of H and it was fairly young men but were had been exposed to HIV virus It wasn't necessarily that they were infected
MILES,NA,H Well if you're HIV positive it's the same difference
HAROLD,NA,Mhm
MILES,NA,since they feel that sooner or later you'll come down with the actual disease
PETE,CA,Mhm
JAMIE,CA,Yeah
MILES,NA,But that's what she said Now I don't know if she meant the Bay area or San Francisco
JAMIE,CA,X
MILES,NA,H but those are some ferocious numbers if one out of

JAMIE,CA,That's <X just X> horrible

HAROLD,NA,See I'd heard that it was mainly
JAMIE,CA,Really dumb
HAROLD,NA,%in t's mainly urban areas
PETE,CA,Yeah
HAROLD,NA,that had this really disproportionately high propor um percentage And then like r rural areas or like you know central Iowa and stuff had like ten percent or less of the males had been infected
MILES,NA,H Well I would assume San Francisco is higher than most cities around the X country X
HAROLD,NA,Unhunh
PETE,CA,Mhm
MILES,NA,But that just blew me away Cause I'm thinking well gee if half of all the men are HIV positive what does that mean about the women they're having sex with
PETE,CA,Right Yeah ENV MUSIC_STARTS
HAROLD,NA,Well
MILES,NA,But and just talking with guys

MILES,NA,Yeah but I didn't feel like she taught it any different significantly differently than when Vivian and Jeff taught it I mean cause they do it
JAMIE,CA,real basic and real simple
MILES,NA,different than Brazilians do it
JAMIE,CA,Yeah
MILES,NA,I mean I don't know what those Brazilian women are doing
JAMIE,CA,What are they doing
MILES,NA,but their hips are like
JAMIE,CA,Are they going are they going like H really fast I mean are they going one two three
MILES,NA,I mean
JAMIE,CA,one two three
MILES,NA,first you had this wide sway of their hips this way and then it's like SLAPPING they're coming I mean they're beating me like HI this SLAPPING I don't even know how you can do that You're dancing with them SLAPPING they're beating you just like this HI SLAPPING
HAROLD,NA,Using their hands like that
PETE,CA,
JAMIE,CA,
MILES,NA,No using their pelvic bones
HAROLD,NA,Wow
PETE,CA,Mm
JAMIE,CA,Right here
MILES,NA,Yeah
PETE,CA,Sort of like Tahitian dancers or something
HAROLD,NA,Yeah
PETE,CA,X You know X> close
MILES,NA,But I tell you
PETE,CA,
MILES,NA,but anyway you know they weren't teaching it that way
HAROLD,NA,X X
MILES,NA,You know the ballroom people don't do it that way
PETE,CA,XX XX
MILES,NA,But that's what I want to learn
JAMIE,CA,Don't Don't they teach H don't they teach you to go one two three one two three one two three like that H Or do they go like really fast like that
MILES,NA,Well Sue Swing I mean when she was teaching was definitely more sedate and the same thing with Jeff and Vivian
JAMIE,CA,Viv Yeah
MILES,NA,It was just Jeff and
JAMIE,CA,sure but that's cause it's for s it's for people who can't move their hips Right I mean it's for basic you know this is a beginning lambada class or intermediate XXXXX
MILES,NA,I don't know why they did it that way I mean it seems to me if X they're gonna teach it like what you do X
JAMIE,CA,Or what they teach and what happens socially could be two different things You know
MILES,NA,I mean Brazilians definitely don't hm do it like that
JAMIE,CA,I should I want to go I should check it out I like that cause it's fun P X X P
MILES,NA,I mean after I f I mean X I X>

MILES,NA,the last night
JAMIE,CA,Yeah P
MILES,NA,And like X well X they were attractive women the one had on a real real short skirt H Anyway there was this guy in his fifties out there dancing BR by himself BR And the woman was just looking at him making eyes then she went out there got on her knees in front of him in this skirt that's this short H takes her hands and goes along his toes and then up and is just doing like that I figured
JAMIE,CA,Oo
MILES,NA,oh they must know each other
JAMIE,CA,Oo
HAROLD,NA,very well in fact
PETE,CA,Mhm
JAMIE,CA,Gross
MILES,NA,That's what I assumed And they did that for the whole dance and I mean she was d all kind of suggestive stuff and touching him and everything people would like cheering CLAP and clapping Q go for it Q And all this kind of HI thing HI The the song ended the guy set down at another table And she set down
JAMIE,CA,at a
MILES,NA,at the table with her woman friend They never danced again the rest of the evening
HAROLD,NA,Hm
MILES,NA,This is like
JAMIE,CA,
PETE,CA,
JAMIE,CA,
PETE,CA,
MILES,NA,so I was thinking this woman's sitting about as far away from me as Jamie is H And I was thinking hm this is interesting H I wonder how long it was gonna take the guys in this club to move in on her No sooner did I think this thought guys were over there H
HAROLD,NA,What you didn't ask her to dance
JAMIE,CA,Not Miles he's just X in daze X
MILES,NA,Well I was still trying to figure out
JAMIE,CA,

JAMIE,CA,H You mean you werestill thinking about it
PETE,CA,@@@
JAMIE,CA,H

JAMIE,CA,Or just some random guy
MILES,NA,No a random guy who was like sitting about where you are
HAROLD,NA,Yeah
MILES,NA,He was sitting there there were two guys sitting at a table right where you are And then these two women are sitting here H So uh he comes over there and is talking with that woman. I don't know about what but then like ten minutes later she and her friend are over at their table And then twenty minutes later they were kinda like all over each other You know kissing et cetera et cetera H And I was thinking it looks like these people aren't going home alone tonight

JAMIE,CA,Uh-oh did you say something
MILES,NA,but I
JAMIE,CA,
MILES,NA,"but I was thinking H but the thing is you know she's kind of all sophisticated and everything and I'm thinking you know this guy I can't really believe that guy's her husband So I don't know what's going on here And of course later on I find out that's not her husband H HI So I'm thinking, you know HI I don't know what's going on here H H But uh Hx bizarre"
JAMIE,CA,Gossip
MILES,NA,But then she tells me gee I don't know what it is about this guy I mean H I've been trying to tell him I don't want a sexual relationship with him and I'm thinking from the way they look when I'd seen them three weeks before it looked to me like they had one I'm thinking you don't do that with

PATRICK,WI,Oh cool SNIFF how's she doing
CORINNA,WI,Okay
PATRICK,WI,I haven't seen her in half a billion years so um but anyways we were like making out and stuff at Duncan lakefront so that's what we regularly PAR well not regularly did this like th two three times something like that PAR H So after Victor's after Tom had two women like fighting over who he's gonna go home with H he went home with this like uh one other girl like a heavy-set girl and H me and Janine and all of us were walking down the hill You know going down where the pier is Except we were going down that big hill And it's like uh me and Janine were used to walking down that steep grassy part and they went around H So we hurried up and went in the grassy part by the tennis courts H It was real dark and you couldn't see us at all after we had gotten to that little plank H So we like hurried up to this one spot we always went to we sat and looked around and Tom and them were yelling and screaming for us H You know and they started making out like a hundred yards away from us SNIFF TSK You know but there's trees and they were standing in front of a tree so you couldn't see them and we were sitting by like a tree H so you couldn't see us So they were making out H and we're sitting there talking and stuff and junk and then it's like H all of a sudden we hear LIPS and that was just the damndest noise and a very distinctive noise
CORINNA,WI,
PATRICK,WI,H so I'm like I know they're not doing what I think they're doing H and we're looking around the corner I couldn't see anything H And then all of a sudden I saw Tom I don't know took a step back or something and I could see Tom H Or something I don't n know on this side of the tree and then I saw a head Or a movement lower than what I saw Tom So then the picture became clear that H he's getting head from this chick he didn't even know

KIRSTEN,MI,TSK Um first of all maybe you guys can tell me we talked a little bit about it last time you were here Or did we not talk about the history of the penguins
AMY,NA,X Thanks X
DON,NA,I wasn't here that weekend
LORI,NA,TSK H No No
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay
LORI,NA,We talked about the endangered species
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay We have
LORI,NA,THROAT
KIRSTEN,MI,on exhibit now about L twenty-five of the thirty penguin chicks L
AMY,NA,Wow
KIR,NA,TEN That you have ENV MIC_NOISE
KIRSTEN,MI,Um
LORI,NA,Oops
KIRSTEN,MI,Last year I s want to say around Christmas time we went down the Shed Aquarium as well as other H researchers and scientists went down to Antarctica to collect
LORI,NA,Mm
KIRSTEN,MI,Gentu penguin eggs Okay so H I want to go into a little bit about the history of the Gentus here um for you For Don and Lori where H Where did our original Gentu penguins come from
DON,NA,Uh Faulklands Wasn't it
KIRSTEN,MI,Where did the But specifically
DON,NA,Oh specifically in the islands
KIRSTEN,MI,Where did we get them for display here at the Shed Aquarium
DON,NA,Oh From the um was it Edinburgh uh Zoo
KIRSTEN,MI,Yeah Great
DON,NA,Yeah
KIRSTEN,MI,In Scotland
DON,NA,Yeah Right
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay
AMY,NA,Are those the ones that don't like people The hands-off ones
KIRSTEN,MI,P Hands-off ones P
AMY,NA,That came from Where's Ten from
KIRSTEN,MI,There
AMY,NA,Or is that Oh okay
KIRSTEN,MI,Yeah
AMY,NA,Well is What's the other species
KIRSTEN,MI,Rockhoppers
AMY,NA,The No
KIRSTEN,MI,Magellanics
DON,NA,Magellanic
LORI,NA,XXXX
AMY,NA,Yeah Okay
KIRSTEN,MI,Ra Magellanics came from the John Ball Zoo in Grand Rapids Michigan
DON,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,TSK H So the Gentus which I take it you work mammals as well
AMY,NA,Yeah
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay so feel free to add in
AMY,NA,I worked with the baby penguins when cause I've only worked like a weekend H but both days were spent with the penguins Feeding the baby penguins and then Ten and all of them
KIRSTEN,MI,Great Great So H feel free after I've go through this information you know
LORI,NA,XX
KIRSTEN,MI,share any information you might have
LORI,NA,Mhm
AMY,NA,Well I'll probably have a lot of questions for you @@@@@
KIRSTEN,MI,from your experiences
AMY,NA,Okay
KIRSTEN,MI,Cause that's  you know
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,usually the best way that we can get some good detailed information is from H volunteers that actually work in mammals So we love that Um CLAP TSK anyway H so we got the penguins our original batch of penguins from from this zoo in Scotland and H um TSK you know as you know you ship them over and they go into a quarantine period And I do believe it was thirty days Don't don't it's in my literature right there I'll check for certain H Uh that is required by the USDA basically there's there's a disease called n Newcastle's Disease that is is very contagious apparently and so there's always the potential of when you bring a bird over contamidate Contaminating the poultry
AMY,NA,Mm
KIRSTEN,MI,Business Okay TSK and so that is th background information for the reason for quarantining H Um with our other penguins H uh we brought them over from Scotland and as it turned out H in a quarantine period that they had H that a vi or I should say a fungus okay this Aspergillosis fungus had come to fruition H and we had lost you know a good portion of penguins H So
AMY,NA,X Wow X
KIRSTEN,MI,okay now it's time to consider replacing these penguins how do we want to go about doing that Well TSK H really didn't want to go through transporting the birds Didn't work last time a potential for bringing over diseases is obviously there so H the thought was okay let's get some eggs H Um Sea World San Diego has Gentus and apparently just not enough eggs to share If they had them they would gladly H Same situation with the Edinburgh Zoo they would gladly send us birds but they didn't feel that they had enough eggs to send over So H we really didn't want to go the bird route and so that left us the choice of going down to Antarctica and collecting some peng some penguin eggs ourselves H TSK So they went to and I don't know if this is pronounced correctly Wiencke Island
LORI,NA,Yeah that's where a lot of seals are from as well
DON,NA,Hm
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,Cool
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,Cool
DON,NA,That'll fit in with your class
LORI,NA,I know @@
KIRSTEN,MI,@Yeah 
ALICE,MI,Nicole is here
KIRSTEN,MI,Hi Nicole
NICOLE,NA,Hi
ALICE,NA,Hey let me
KIRSTEN,MI,how you doing
ALICE,MI,Can I just interrupt for one minute
NICOLE,NA,<X Oh X okay
ALICE,NA,can I see your ID
NICOLE,NA,Mine
ALICE,NA,I don't think Darren put anything on it
NICOLE,NA,HI Mhm HI
ALICE,NA,Right Okay
KIRSTEN,MI,Why don't you have a seat
NICOLE,NA,Sure
LORI,NA,SNORT H P<X Oh I'm tired X>P
KIRSTEN,MI,So they went to Wiencke Island where a lot of seals are from and
LORI,NA,Mhm
AMY,NA,XXXX
LORI,NA, 
NICOLE,NA, X
KIRSTEN,MI, collected eggs
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay so the process was I'm just gonna finish up on my story H the process was was they um TSK they went to the nest okay from our staff it was Mark Ryan from marine mammals and Mike Mulligan from fishes and frankly I I'm not quite sure who the entourage of other people were But H they went to the nest and basically waited for the penguin to stand up and checked to see if there were two eggs there
AMY,NA,Hm
KIRSTEN,MI,Gentu penguins and this isn isn't true of all penguins often H when a penguin lays eggs if it lays two one is smaller than the other H Gentus lay two equally sized eggs TSK Okay H um
LORI,NA,Hm
KIRSTEN,MI,the reason I mentioned that was if one was smaller he would have went for the smaller egg Okay
DON,NA,Why
KIRSTEN,MI,Because that would probably mean that
LORI,NA,TSK Female
KIRSTEN,MI,Do you remember reading in the exhibit for the Rockhopper penguins downstairs H they lay two different sized eggs
DON,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,TSK Depending on the year and depending on the conditions of light um if it's a bad year or there's just not a lot of food resources H um environmental conditions are rough it's a stormy bad year
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,H A penguin might lay two eggs and at that point P I don't P I don't really wanna use the word VOX decide VOX
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,H that's kind of anthropomorphic but H somehow figure out Q at this point I'm gonna kick out an egg Q
LORI,NA,Determine
DON,NA,Ah
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,I'm going to determine through whatever
AMY,NA,Mm
KIRSTEN,MI,however it does determine to do so
NICOLE,NA,Hm
KIRSTEN,MI,H will kick out an egg
NICOLE,NA,THROAT
KIRSTEN,MI,Otherwise it will brood the two eggs and hatch em out TSK It's not uncommon that at this point they'll kick out the smaller chick
DON,NA,Right
KIRSTEN,MI,If at that point conditions don't seem to be H sufficient to support raising two of em it's kind of like hey why bother
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,And kick out one of One of the chicks If it's a F great year on fat there's food di it's a beautiful day F
DON,NA,It's called penguin euthanasia
LORI,NA,Hx @
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay
DON,NA,@@
KIRSTEN,MI,Hx
DON,NA,WH @ WH>
KIRSTEN,MI,H They'll they'll they'll try to raise both
LORI,NA,H
KIRSTEN,MI,So
LORI,NA,
KIRSTEN,MI,I didn't catch that What wa
DON,NA,It's called penguin euthanasia
KIRSTEN,MI,Sh
LORI,NA,@@
KIRSTEN,MI,Ch TSK H WH Yeah WH>
LORI,NA,@@
KIRSTEN,MI,H Um so anyway TSK Apparently what th what they Now at this point they wanted to see okay now is there actually a fertile Is there a fertile chick or developing chick inside
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,And H apparently it was very very muddy it was abnormally warm and it was just a big mudbath out there and they couldn't H They couldn't clean off the mud enough to be able to see inside To see if if it was viable So H they took an egg from nests that had two eggs H And I think this this report says within thirty-one hours H the eggs were back here in Chicago
LORI,NA,TSK Wow
KIRSTEN,MI,TSK That's pretty neat
NICOLE,NA,Oh
KIRSTEN,MI,And then they took them to an L off-site incubation area L in Addison Is anybody from Addison I don't know where Addison is
NICOLE,NA,X I don't either s X X It's a west suburb
KIRSTEN,MI,West
AMY,NA,X Yes X
KIRSTEN,MI,H So they were out in the west suburbs And incubated there X
AMY,NA,Hx
LORI,NA,TSK Mm
AMY,NA,SNIFF
KIRSTEN,MI,And apparently now they're about six to seven weeks old
NICOLE,NA,Wow
AMY,NA,When I was here two weeks ago they were sixty days
KIRSTEN,MI,T s two weeks ago it was sixty days
AMY,NA,I think maybe it was four weeks ago
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay
AMY,NA,Yeah
KIRSTEN,MI,I think I think they're around six weeks old
LORI,NA,Mm
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay But when you see them you'll see that they're just about as big as number ten They're big
LORI,NA,N-kay
AMY,NA,Yeah When I Yeah when I was here they had they were losing all of their hair And they looked the two oldest ones looked like Ten
KIRSTEN,MI,Right Right H So basically what the process has been is H we brought them here as chicks but they still had their downy feathers Okay so H as they lost their downy feathers they became eligible to go out onto exhibit H And so what they did last time you guys were here there was maybe ten That were you know I say eligible to be out on exhibit
NICOLE,NA,
KIRSTEN,MI,and what they would do is they would carry them in H let them hang out for about a half an hour get acclimated to what was going on and then take them off H And do this H Now they're out Now they're they are out on exhibit
DON,NA,TSK All of them
KIRSTEN,MI,Almost all of em Two days ago there was twenty-five out on exhibit So we have thirty chicks total
DON,NA,Right
LORI,NA,Hm
KIRSTEN,MI,H So twenty-five plus are out on exhibit
DON,NA,TSK Okay
KIRSTEN,MI,TSK H Um H thing of it is is let's think a little bit about penguin natural history Okay How how long do penguins spend on land
DON,NA,Three months I think
KIRSTEN,MI,What's your guess
LORI,NA,H Uh
DON,NA,Three or is it three to six months
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay
LORI,NA,TSK H Um four Five
KIRSTEN,MI,Six
DON,NA,Six
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay
NICOLE,NA,Six months
KIRSTEN,MI,So it's it's basically
NICOLE,NA,Wow
KIRSTEN,MI,it's an even even split
DON,NA,THROAT
KIRSTEN,MI,between life out at sea and life on land H So the sequence of events is they come on to shore springtime H they hook up with their mate they build a nest they mate they lay their eggs H they brood their eggs they hatch their chicks they brood their chicks they feed their chicks H they molt and then they're out to sea So all of that has to happen within that six-month period H that's a pretty busy bird
LORI,NA,
NICOLE,NA,@@@@@@@@@@@@
KIRSTEN,MI,so
DON,NA,H WH  WH>
KIRSTEN,MI,the penguins need to grow the chicks in order to be ready to go out there for six months out at sea really need to be very well suited for that
DON,NA,THROAT
KIRSTEN,MI,So they nee need to be big they need to be hefty H they need to have their adult feathers so
AMY,NA,Mm
KIRSTEN,MI,between the time that they actually hatch out and the time that they're ready to go out to sea is just a couple of months
NICOLE,NA,How long does it take for them to hatch
KIRSTEN,MI,TSK H Well the incubation period
NICOLE,NA,Or um X to have experience X
KIRSTEN,MI,is anywhere depends on the species it's it's one month to two months
NICOLE,NA,Oh okay
KIRSTEN,MI,TSK Okay so therefore you know basically between building a nest and mating and all of that other stuff you know they I would say that they have three months to to grow and get ready Okay So they're big Now the funny thing is is that according to Mark Ryan H VOX well VOX hmm
NICOLE,NA,Hx
KIRSTEN,MI,Or just interesting I guess H Go watch them um
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,if you watch the trainers they walk into the exhibit and they H start throwing penguins into the water And pushing them in and they're H all over the place um
NICOLE,NA,
KIRSTEN,MI,they try to get out sometimes they make it sometimes they fall back in H Gentus usually dive in head first these guys are falling in
AMY,NA,Hx H
KIRSTEN,MI,jumping in diving in so their H behaviors if you will are are really interesting Okay
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,It's just it's just a lot of fun to watch them H Um they're doing something different with these chicks than we've done with the other penguins is that they're trying to feed them crill TSK H Um yesterday I think is th is th is when they tried it for the first time H and that crill is about as big as
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,you know from my joint up to the top of my finger here H so it's very difficult for a person to hold a crill
NICOLE,NA,
KIRSTEN,MI,and drop it into a penguin's mouth So very good f s food source for them that's what they would feed on in the wild in addition to other things H so what they're trying to do is they're throwing the crill into the water and seeing if the chicks'll go for it H So they tried it yesterday and they had some mixed success you know some animals were interested others weren't H So y a apparently they they'll keep doing this So Did Were they weren't doing that when you were in there
AMY,NA,No No no no
KIRSTEN,MI, Okay TSK H When they were chicks cause what is it How does a mother H feed a penguin chick
LORI,NA,Doesn't she bring food to it
AMY,NA,She regurgitates it
KIRSTEN,MI,She regurgitates it
LORI,NA,Oh
KIRSTEN,MI,I sh shouldn't say she cause mother and father share
LORI,NA,Both
NICOLE,NA,Oh
KIRSTEN,MI,share the duties okay H But yeah they go out they feed and they regurgitate up the food and that's how they feed the chicks
NICOLE,NA,Mm
LORI,NA,TSK H Actually other birds do that as well
KIRSTEN,MI,A lot
AMY,NA,Mhm
LORI,NA,Don't they a lot of birds do
AMY,NA,Yeah
KIRSTEN,MI,Yeah A lot of birds do
LORI,NA,That's right THROAT
KIRSTEN,MI,They never really did any Hx well we h didn't regurgitate for them H but
LORI,NA,
KIRSTEN,MI,they started them off with um strips of fish and they actually dipped it in a vitamin and um TSK pureed crill batter
LORI,NA,Mm
NICOLE,NA,@@@
KIRSTEN,MI,Dipped it in and then gave it to the penguin chicks So they've been on solid food
LORI,NA,Hm
KIRSTEN,MI,for quite some time and now it's just interesting to see if they'll just go for the crill itself
AMY,NA,Are they I mean are they being hesitant about it
KIRSTEN,MI,TSK H I didn't see it Yesterday was the first time
AMY,NA,Because
KIRSTEN,MI,they did it at eleven thirty and four o'clock Where the
AMY,NA,That's really interesting because I mean going from being hand-fed
KIRSTEN,MI,TSK Right Right So I don't know So I would say if you've got the time H or if you wanna make the time to be down there at four thirty H hopefully they'll do it again today and it'll be interesting to see so I'll find out from Mark Um you know what the response with that is
LORI,NA,So four thirty's chick feeding
KIRSTEN,MI,Yes
DON,NA,Are there any particular trainers working with the penguins uh hm Are all the trainers allowed to work with the penguins
KIRSTEN,MI,Yeah Well basically here um H all of the trainers work with all of the animals So they rotate them around basically P Excuse me P So that the animals don't get attached to one person Because if that person decides to leave then that could be detrimental to the animals But we do have a lead a lead H person for each animal
LORI,NA,
KIRSTEN,MI,Mark Ryan is lead penguins
DON,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,Meg is lead otter Lisa Takaki was lead lag
DON,NA,X
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,Greg is lead seal So H Mark is basically calling the shots for how the program's gonna be structured So he's H he's the penguin trivia guy TSK H So H it's a neat story
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,it's it's a very neat background story H and I think you know for s for some of us underwater viewing gallery has not been H your favorite place H so this could this could bring new light to the underwater viewing gallery
LORI,NA,Could be a gift
KIRSTEN,MI,and actually H just give a new focus on the penguins We haven't done as much interpretation with the penguins as we do with the other animals so H you actually have some kinda neat things to interpret here As far as what's going on TSK H Some other things that you might see H the penguins segregate themselves The species don't intermix Okay if you've noticed that before
NICOLE,NA,Mm
KIRSTEN,MI,the Rockhoppers pretty much station themselves in the center H the Magellanics used to be off to the right
DON,NA,COUGH
KIRSTEN,MI,and then well number ten could do whatever she wanted
AMY,NA,Hx
DON,NA, TSK The Gentu
KIRSTEN,MI,H But
NICOLE,NA,What's number ten I k
KIRSTEN,MI,TSK H I'm sorry
NICOLE,NA,I I k s
AMY,NA,@Hx
NICOLE,NA,I k I keep going
KIRSTEN,MI,Number ten
NICOLE,NA,what's number ten here 
AMY,NA,@Hx H
NICOLE,NA,@@
KIRSTEN,MI,Kay the the penguins are numbered
NICOLE,NA,Oh okay
KIRSTEN,MI,Each penguin is numbered
NICOLE,NA,Hx
KIRSTEN,MI,And on on ... the arm
LORI,NA,X Wing X
DON,NA,@Hx H
KIRSTEN,MI,okay the the joint here well what do you call this
DON The,MI,wing X P Humerus P
DON,NA,Hm
KIRSTEN,MI,At the humerus
DON,NA,Hu
KIRSTEN,MI,We would have a tag
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,H and they're color-coded so if you were like to see TSK well how does it work Give me a number
AMY,NA,Well they wear colors When I was there
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay H They're colors but H
AMY,NA,Just seven Did they move em to numbers
KIRSTEN,MI,TSK
AMY,NA,They were going to
KIRSTEN,MI,What it is is that green let's say for example green stands for one black stands for two That's number twelve
AMY,NA,Is that how it works
KIRSTEN,MI,Yeah
AMY,NA,Okay
KIRSTEN,MI,H So TSK they number them so that when they're feeding them and they're taking down the records of okay number twelve ate five Columbia River smelts and two
NICOLE,NA,H THROAT
KIRSTEN,MI,Capelands
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,They can keep a record of what the animal eats Okay so they don't have names but H she because sh Because she's H the lone feisty penguin number ten has become kind of famous in the penguin world downstairs So it it it's a female
NICOLE,NA,
KIRSTEN,MI,th the only female Gentu penguin H that we had prior to the chicks coming in
NICOLE,NA,Okay
KIRSTEN,MI,TSK Okay so H um now you'll see that they're segregated actually the Gentus have kind of broken up into clumps H and there's From what I saw yesterday three different clumps H um TSK let's see Let's G Let's interpret some of the behaviors we might see Okay what is what is a penguin standing out with its arms like this I shouldn't say arms Its
NICOLE,NA,@@
LORI,NA,Wings
AMY,NA,Hx
DON,NA,Wings
KIRSTEN,MI, Its wings
NICOLE,NA,Wings
AMY,NA,@H
KIRSTEN,MI,H
LORI,NA,H
KIRSTEN,MI,Right
LORI,NA,Um
DON,NA,Perspiring
LORI,NA,actually cooling off
DON,NA,Cooling off
LORI,NA,isn't it
KIRSTEN,MI, Yeah Yeah
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,H So right here is where you don't where the penguins don't have a a dense covering of feathers H So if they wanna cool off they tend to do this H Okay if I was to see a penguin doing this lifting one leg up
LORI,NA,TSK It's resting Isn't it
KIRSTEN,MI,What else could it be
AMY,NA,Sleeping P No P
NICOLE,NA,Balance I guess
KIRSTEN,MI,It's balancing
AMY,NA,Hx
KIRSTEN,MI,it's doing thinking tricks
NICOLE,NA,@@@@
DON,NA, 
AMY,NA,@@@@@
KIRSTEN,MI,HUm
NICOLE,NA,H
KIRSTEN,MI,actually it would be conserving heat H Okay
NICOLE,NA,Oh
DON,NA,Hm
KIRSTEN,MI,So the wings and the f legs feet
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,there's no dense feather coverage on the on the legs so they might be conserving heat TSK H Okay um TSK if H I saw a penguin SNEEZE sneezing
NICOLE,NA,
KIRSTEN,MI,What might be happening there
NICOLE,NA,Allergic To food
KIRSTEN,MI,
AMY,NA,Sick
DON,NA, I've never heard a  penguin sneezing but 
AMY,NA, H 
NICOLE,NA,@H
AMY,NA,@
NICOLE,NA,H Cold
DON,NA,Hx
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay
DON,NA,Hx
LORI,NA,It actually kind of sneezes
NICOLE,NA,I know could you hear it H
AMY,NA,Hx
NICOLE,NA,How can you tell from it like shaking his head
KIRSTEN,MI,You'll
NICOLE,NA,or sneezing
KIRSTEN,MI,you'll see him You'll see him just like X what X a person sneezing
NICOLE,NA,Oh okay
KIRSTEN,MI,you can tell
DON,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,When they jerk their head like that H How was how does a penguin get its fresh water TSK How does a penguin drink
NICOLE,NA,Oh
LORI,NA,I haven't studied penguins in a while Don do you know
DON,NA,TSK No
LORI,NA,Hm-mm
DON,NA,From I thought a way w Drank from pools Just
KIRSTEN,MI,They'll drink salt water
DON,NA,Salt water
KIRSTEN,MI,all also you know like the dolphins they actually H metabolize the water that's stored in in the fat of the fish that they eat And that's how they get their water source
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,But basically you've gotta separate H the fresh water from the salt water actually just have to separate out that salt H So they have a special s-
NICOLE,NA,They have to do that
LORI,NA,HSo that's how they're do
NICOLE,NA,Oh
LORI,NA,That's what they're doing when they sneeze is they're getting rid of the salt
KIRSTEN,MI,Salt
NICOLE,NA,Oh
KIRSTEN,MI,That they have accumulated They have a salt gland In the beak And that is what separates the salt out
DON,NA,Did you know that before
KIRSTEN,MI,And to get rid of that salt they
LORI,NA,Hm-mm
DON,NA,Me neither
KIRSTEN,MI,SNEEZE they sneeze
LORI,NA,TSK H Yeah actually
NICOLE,NA,Oh I never even thought of that
LORI,NA,I remember doing the penguin thing a year ago but I don't remember that adaptation
DON,NA,No
LORI,NA,H Oh well
KIRSTEN,MI,TSK Um we're gonna have to go up and do Q and A in three minutes Hx H Just looking at the clock
LORI,NA,Who's do
KIRSTEN,MI,I'm facing the clock
LORI,NA,Who's the diver
KIRSTEN,MI,H I don't Oh probably Bernie TSK H Um
NICOLE,NA,Do they have different divers every
LORI,NA,Mhm
NICOLE,NA,time
KIRSTEN,MI,Yeah every day P Every day P
NICOLE,NA,Oh
KIRSTEN,MI,So that would be excreting salt Um when I see a penguin H picking its butt What is it doing
NICOLE,NA,
AMY,NA,@@
LORI,NA,H TSK Preening Hx H Kinda like picking at its feathers
DON,NA,Preening Preening
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay
LORI,NA,Preening
KIRSTEN,MI,It's preening what is it doing What's at the base of the tail
DON,NA,Hx H Hx
KIRSTEN,MI,This is fun you guys
DON,NA,H Yeah right
AMY,NA,Hx 
LORI,NA,It's at the
NICOLE,NA,It is fun
KIRSTEN,MI,  H
DON,NA,@ H 
LORI,NA,Hx
KIRSTEN,MI,H SM What's at the base of the tail SM
NICOLE,NA,I X wouldn't've X even thought of these things
DON,NA,Well the anus is at the end of the tail
NICOLE,NA,it's like oh didn't know they had meaning 
KIRSTEN,MI,Pardon me
DON,NA,Right The anus is at the end of the tail
KIRSTEN,MI,That is that is very true
DON,NA,Right
KIRSTEN,MI,but
DON,NA,But
KIRSTEN,MI,let's say near the anus What might be there
DON,NA,Why don't you answer this question
LORI,NA,I got preening
DON,NA,@Hx @@@
LORI,NA,
NICOLE,NA, Ah
KIRSTEN,MI,It's okay
LORI,NA,H It's
KIRSTEN,MI,It's the preening gland
DON,NA,Hx Yeah
LORI,NA,TSK Oh okay
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay so it's a gland that stores oil so what a penguin will do is it'll go back it'll squeeze the gland
DON,NA,COUGH
KIRSTEN,MI,H it'll get some oil on its beak and then H it's rubbing that waterproofing
LORI,NA,H So it can keep itself waterproof right
DON,NA,Mm
KIRSTEN,MI,waterproofing
LORI,NA,Mhm
NICOLE,NA,Oh
KIRSTEN,MI,all over its feathers
AMY,NA,Hm
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,Preening also consists of H working an air layer at the base of the feathers because air is a better insulator than water If there was water touching the skin
LORI,NA,Hm
KIRSTEN,MI,H water is like a vacuum cleaner It is just gonna suck the heat away
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,so by having the air there H it's a better insulator H So when I see a penguin dive into the water and I see all of these little air bubbles coming out what am I seeing
LORI,NA,The air is r Is
DON,NA,Escaping from the feathers
LORI,NA,escaping Right
KIRSTEN,MI,Is compressed out
LORI,NA,From the
KIRSTEN,MI,CH CH so the penguin comes up on land and let's start again
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,And will start preening H working that air layer in H getting some oil
LORI,NA,H
KIRSTEN,MI,spreading it out
LORI,NA, How often do the
DON,NA,Mm
LORI,NA,How d often does the bird molt
KIRSTEN,MI,TSK H
LORI,NA,Once a year
KIRSTEN,MI,Once a year
LORI,NA,Okay
KIRSTEN,MI,Some species'll molt twice
LORI,NA, Twice
KIRSTEN,MI,H But basically if you think about it you know a year of picking at the feathers the feathers are gonna wear out
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,H So the last thing that a penguin does before it goes out to sea is
LORI,NA,Shed its yeah
NICOLE,NA,Okay
KIRSTEN,MI,It does a clean sweep
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,And molts all of its feathers off And then gets the new feathers on TSK H Okay H So other than that um really the only training That they do with the penguins You know we train all kinds of behaviors with the other animals H The the the the training that they do with the penguins is basically that they have feeding stations for them
DON,NA,Hm
KIRSTEN,MI,H Uh Rockhoppers is here uh Gentus is here Magellanics is here and you are not gonna get a fish unless you come to your feeding station
LORI,NA,TSK Do they pretty much know that by now Have they pretty much adapted to that
AMY,NA,H They were still in the room
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay
AMY,NA,When when I was here And they were they were pretty random about it because Mark would take you know a bucket over here
KIRSTEN,MI,Right And that was with the chicks
AMY,NA,and then whoever yeah
KIRSTEN,MI,Okay
AMY,NA,With the H HI yeah HI I mean the ones that were in there
LORI,NA,The adult penguins
AMY,NA,they yeah the adult ones were fine about it
LORI,NA,Mhm
AMY,NA,you know someone set up over here and someone over here and they pretty much went where they were supposed to
LORI,NA,So they knew to go to station one
AMY,NA,Yeah Versus station two
KIRSTEN,MI,Right
AMY,NA,Yeah
LORI,NA,Okay
KIRSTEN,MI,So I guess Not I'm not I'm not sure but H it's just kind of interesting because other facilities as far as I'm aware it's like with the sea otters as well H you know the training that they do with these animals is pretty minimal With the sea otters they're pretty They can be aggressive they have big teeth H People have historically done more training with cetaceans than they have with H other animals and we we really do some pretty unique training here H with our penguins with our sea otters and with our seals
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,So It's kinda neat stuff
LORI,NA,Cool
KIRSTEN,MI,TSK Anything else About penguins that we should discuss For you guys the key to the penguin cart if you d Well I don't
LORI,NA,The puffin cart
KIRSTEN,MI,Are Yeah the
DON,NA,Puffin cart
LORI,NA,Mhm
KIRSTEN,MI,H Is on is behind the tide pool On one of re the reserve tanks So if you choose to pick a specimen H you don't have to bring the whole cart out If you wanna grab a specimen
DON,NA,Hm
KIRSTEN,MI,and bring it out to the exhibit that's fine But H I suggest that you check it out today anyway um TSK there's just There's some neat things to interpret So H Check it out
LORI,NA,You've got underwater viewing
DON,NA,Yeah At three
KIRSTEN,MI,Check it out So if there's a time you know for Lori to go do it H
LORI,NA,TSK Well I'll probably go between coastal I'll probably meander coastal downstairs
KIRSTEN,MI,TSK Okay

KIRSTEN,MI,Okay Great
LORI,NA,Oh wait Never mind I'll do it then When there's a presentation at three

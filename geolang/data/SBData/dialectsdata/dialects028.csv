JILL,CA,@@ Well H I'll

JILL,CA,Ecstasy of sorts H 
JEFF,CA,X Wait X tell me what Well see I The reas I have H I kinda TSK I wasn't inclined to call you
JILL,CA,Unhunh
JEFF,CA,Because I just wanted to give you and Jill your time
JILL,CA,Yeah
JEFF,CA,You know Like I felt like
JILL,CA,Totally
JEFF,CA,H you know so that's H I let There were a couple times when I wanted to call you and I didn't for that reason
JILL,CA,Uh Unhunh Aw thanks H Yeah well the thing was I hadn't told you H But my period is really late You know And I guess we would talk and then we'd hang up and then I thought oh gosh I forgot to tell you H But
JEFF,CA,I've been meaning to ask you about that
JILL,CA,Really You were X getting nervous X
JEFF,CA,You haven't had it yet?
JILL,CA,H No I mean and it's been so long And so it's like eight days late H And I thought I'm sure I'm pregnant I'm positive And I was waiting till Jill got here
JEFF,CA,WH<X That's bad X>WH
JILL,CA,H to even try  to  check
JEFF,CA,@Oh Yeah
JILL,CA,H And um so we went to go get an EPT at pregnancy test
JEFF,CA,X Yeah X
JILL,CA,And then we d That's why we were calling you last night You know H
JEFF,CA,What happened
JILL,CA,And then of course it came out fine H So that's the
JEFF,CA,It came out negative
JILL,CA,Yeah so that's the relief and the ecstasy.
JEFF,CA,So H y you can't be pregnant
JILL,CA,No I don't No Unless it was a false negative
JEFF,CA,X
JILL,CA,which I doubt H Because
JEFF,CA,TSK That's rare Right
JILL,CA,Right I think that would be really rare
JEFF,CA,So H th you know what I mean like can would it come out nega Let's say i i f you were pregnant in its early st early early stages
JILL,CA,Mhm
JEFF,CA,Like wo Like would a negative You know what I'm saying
JILL,CA,H Hx M
JEFF,CA,Like could you get Is it possible that you could still be posi positive
JILL,CA,H I think there'd be a slight chance of it being a false negative H But I don't think so cause I'm pretty late And I think I'm late enough H where I would have like enough of the hormone that the pregnancy test tests for H I think I would have enough of that in my urine that of course it would show up if I had any in there
JEFF,CA,Yeah
JILL,CA,H You know So I I I'm pret I took that as a pretty good H sign
JEFF,CA,Oh my god
JILL,CA,You know
JEFF,CA,Honey how come you've been keeping all this inside
JILL,CA,TSK I know I didn't mean to keep it inside
JEFF,CA,X
JILL,CA,I mean I didn't mean
JEFF,CA,Don't you love me
JILL,CA,TSK<@Oh@>
JEFF,CA,@Aw
JILL,CA,I didn't mean to not tell you at all It was just we would hang up the phone then I thought oh yeah I forgot to mention that I'm kinda late H Cause I didn't think it was a huge deal H but then I guess I wasn't trying I think I was in a bit of denial Like I wasn't really thinking about it much H You know cause I knew once Jill got here then I would go get the test
JEFF,CA,So is that all the drama
JILL,CA,TSK That was the drama And that was the suspense H and that was the relief and that was the ecstasy
JEFF,CA,Really
JILL,CA,Unhunh
JEFF,CA,TSK H Oh honey

JEFF,CA,X
JILL,CA,you know it's like such a momentous occasion like what if it came out positive
JEFF,CA,
JILL,CA,"and then I thought, H of cour Like I'm know I wouldn't have it or anything but I thought if the slight chance I would have it and it really became a person someday, H wouldn't they love to see the photograph of the EPT"

JEFF,CA,Degener Yeah It's kinda weird
JILL,CA,
JEFF,CA,Hunh.
JILL,CA,TSK H Yeah
JEFF,CA,The whole cycle of life What a fucking trip Hx
JILL,CA,Hx I know
JEFF,CA,Oh but di I d I know you would you get excited about things like this too but did you read in the paper H about the um planets cir circulating around other stars
JILL,CA,No what about them
JEFF,CA,There's irr irreb irred H There's proof What's the what's the word that goes before proof.
JILL,CA,H Irrefutable
JEFF,CA,Irrefutable @proof
JILL,CA,H What's the word that goes before proof 
JEFF,CA,@@@ There thank you honey That was so good
JILL,CA,H
JEFF,CA,What a good team we are
JILL,CA,
JEFF,CA,H I could just see myself like lecturing to a bunch of people and SNIFF like H oh honey by the way What's that word that H
JILL,CA,H that goes before honor
JEFF,CA,<MRC irrefutable MRC Jeff I'm like
JILL,CA,
JEFF,CA,Q oh yes yes yes thank you very much What would I be without her Q
JILL,CA,
JEFF,CA,H
JILL,CA,H
JEFF,CA,Um wouldn't that be funny
JILL,CA,Yeah
JEFF,CA,Aw honey H Wouldn't that be funny
JILL,CA,SM That would be SM
JEFF,CA,Like if someone was lecturing And they said X they looked at you X H
JILL,CA,
JEFF,CA,they said Q is my wife here Q m_well
JILL,CA,H
JEFF,CA,and then she raises her hand
JILL,CA,H
JEFF,CA,H Q Oh honey what wor were we talking about the other night
JILL,CA,<Q What's that word I'm looking for honey
JEFF,CA,"you know when Q>, "
JILL,CA,H You know what I'm talking about Q
JEFF,CA,H I Wouldn't the whole place just laugh
JILL,CA,Yeah I think X it's X so funny
JEFF,CA,TSK H Okay anyway H Can I run this by you really quick
JILL,CA,Unhunh
JEFF,CA,TSK H There's this scientist that came up with irrefutable proof that H there are there they found two planets circulating around a sun Or a star H in the universe outside of our solar system
JILL,CA,BR<WI Really WI>BR
JEFF,CA,And so H which like made me think you know like H you know like how we have always talked about life being out there you know
JILL,CA,Unhunh
JEFF,CA,like there has to be Cause there's planets evolving around H um
JILL,CA,Unhunh
JEFF,CA,SNIFF you know various stars and stuff Just like ours
JILL,CA,Unhunh
JEFF,CA,H And but see I never knew that that was just a theory You know an a theory that there were planets going around other stars
JILL,CA,You mean you actually thought that we had seen this before
JEFF,CA,H No X No X Actually tha I I No I didn't I just H I just thought that it was like pretty much factual
JILL,CA,Oh yeah
JEFF,CA,X
JILL,CA,not at all
JEFF,CA,H So Hx you know So it's kind of like a leap of faith you know that we have always thought that
JILL,CA,M
JEFF,CA,You know I mean like H like the scientist who who does X it X can't really prove it Like they they make this leap of faith H you know they just assume Right that there w there were planets
JILL,CA,Mhm
JEFF,CA,H around other suns  Right
JILL,CA,H Right Just by the sheer numbers They thought H well what are the chances You know f we have billions and millions of stars then chances are H You know even if it takes like one in a million chance for there to be another planetary system Well H like X we have millions and millions and billions of opportunities to have that happen
JEFF,CA,Unhunh
JILL,CA,TSK So H I think that's the whole thing like Carl Sagan would always go yeah Q billions and billions Q like H he would say that
JEFF,CA,Unhunh
JILL,CA,I think he would say that H But yeah So anyhow H like w in what galaxy Like what solar Like what what galaxy was this star in
JEFF,CA,Santa Barbara
JILL,CA,
JEFF,CA,No H I'm not sure
JILL,CA,H

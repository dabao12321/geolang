EVELYN,NA,Another thing I thought was interesting H was the this uh the emphasis on transportation Do you remember the automobile This was the beginning of the uh change
LINDA,AL,Mhm
PATTY,KS,<P XXXXX X P>
EVELY,KS, SNIFF
EVELYN,NA,uh trains and uh
PATTY,KS,carriages
EVELYN,NA,automobiles
LINDA,AL,Unhunh
EVELYN,NA,and uh X Hm
PATTY,KS,TSK H I think Margaret though
LINDA,AL,Mhm
PATTY,KS,I I don't think we can underestimate her Hx I mean I think she's a like a lot of women that I have known I mean she's in control X
PATTY,KS,there is no doubt I mean H Henry Wilcox may think he's in control but he isn't X Hm
PATTY,KS,H And there would never be a Jacky Bast X SNIFF
PATTY,KS,While she is uh the head of of that h household H Whereas I thought Missis Wilc the first Missis Wilcox Ruth
LINDA,AL,Mhm
PATTY,KS,H Was so other worldly and everything else
LINDA,AL,mhm
PATTY,KS,She didn't even have a clue as to what was going on X Mhm
PATTY,KS,H So I felt that that uh Margaret is
JANICE,KS,THROAT
PATTY,KS,is and I thought for this time she was tremendously uh just in charge
LINDA,AL,She's very practical
PATTY,KS,Yeah
DIANE,MN,Mhm
PATTY,KS,and she didn't care H the to b to she didn't care about emancipation
LINDA,AL,Mhm
PATTY,KS,I mean
LINDA,AL,Mhm
PATTY,KS,she was
LINDA,AL,Mhm
PATTY,KS,So she when you really are already that way H you don't have to make a big to-do about it
EVELYN,NA,Mhm
LINDA,AL,Mhm X Mhm
DIANE,MN,<X but she also X>
LOIS,MO,I thought also in the movie she had a very strong personality A lot of charisma
LINDA,AL,Mhm
LOIS,MO,H And very positive
DEBORAH,NA,Did you see the movie Diane
DIANE,MN,Hm-m
LOIS,MO,which is also what you're saying But
LINDA,AL,Mhm
LOIS,MO,H but she just radiated something which was personality
LINDA,AL,Mhm
EVELY,AL, H You know a funny there are two young people that I have talked to about the movie and I haven't seen it but H one of them uh was my niece and I said something about Margaret talking about her feeling that she was the H I think I used the word heroine H And she said Q heroine Q And she couldn't see Margaret as a heroine I think Margaret X XX
EVELYN,NA,and then she went on to explain she said H maybe she was too strong Uh we're used to seeing someone as the uh you know the protagonist or the the woman on the screen as a romantic as uh all of that And I I haven't seen the movie but that was her feeling about it X Hm
LINDA,AL,Hunh
SUE,WI,Had she read the book also You
EVELYN,NA,No @no @@
SUE,WI,t-
LINDA,AL,Just the 
EVELYN,NA,No
SUE,WI,because-
EVELYN,NA,XX goes to movies
SUE,WI,Okay
DIANE,MN,
EVELYN,NA,And an-
SUE,WI,be- Because the other thing about Margaret that would be H uh a heroine is that she
LINDA,AL,THROAT throat
SUE,WI,marries Henry even though all this has happened and then she she sticks with Henry
EVELYN,NA,mhm
SUE,WI,even though all You know
LINDA,AL,COUGH
EVELYN,NA,Mhm
SUE,WI,The son ends up killing
LINDA,AL,COUGH
SUE,WI,You know
LINDA,AL,THROAT THROAT THROAT
SUE,WI,all this happens and she sticks it out with Henry
LINDA,AL,THROAT
EVELYN,NA,Yeah
SUE,WI,H And that maybe young people nowadays wouldn't have done
EVELYN,NA,XX
LINDA,AL,H
SUE,WI,They wouldn't have thought that heroic They would have thought that marching out and saying VOX I won't stay VOX you know or
EVELYN,NA,Mhm
SUE,WI,H VOX I won't marry you VOX or
LINDA,AL,H
SUE,WI,whatever
EVELYN,NA,MM
LINDA,AL,I I wanted to know H THROAT excuse me I wanted to know what you thought about why she agreed to marry him to begin with Because although I understand H the reasons that are given in the book H I still couldn't quite decide that that's something she would have decided to do
EVELYN,NA,Uh X but X I n I know what you mean The only thing I was thinking maybe she was older Her chances were You know it was changing
LINDA,AL,Mm
EVELYN,NA,And uh because she was very pleased when he asked her
JANICE,KS,Ha
LINDA,AL,and she admired him according to the b-
EVELYN,NA,mm
JANICE,KS,well I don't think Henry was the horrible person that
LINDA,AL,but
JANICE,KS,uh a lot of critics felt that he was H I think maybe Forster wanted him to be that way and I just didn't look at it that way
LINDA,AL,Mhm
JANICE,KS,when I read about him But I thought he had a lot of good qualities
LINDA,AL,Did you see some charm there
JANICE,KS,Mhm
SUE,WI,Hm X Hx H
LINDA,AL,Okay
JANICE,KS,Mhm
LINDA,AL,Hm This is for the movie She evidently did Uhuh
JANICE,KS,Mhm
LORI,KS,Well the book she kept saying he was charming
DIANE,MN,Mhm
JANICE,KS,Well I read the book too
LORI,KS,<X I mean he X>
JANICE,KS,and I
LORI,KS,he r- he uh she described him as a charming
EVELYN,NA,mhm
LORI,KS,when she was talking about him to somebody Helen or th in her thoughts or something H Margaret said you know he I mean Mister Wilcox is a charming man
EVELYN,NA,Hm
LINDA,AL,Yeah
JANICE,KS,Hm Well as long as things are going his way
LINDA,AL,H I guess I couldn't see any charm Either place
DIANE,MN,H
LINDA,AL,and and I I guess that's what kept H kinda s bringing me up short on
DIANE,MN,
LINDA,AL,believing this marriage
EVELYN,NA,after all X or X and the times too Linda you know nineteen ten
DIANE,MN,Mhm
EVELYN,NA,there wasn't a great deal of opportunity for a uh
DIANE,MN,I was gonna say didn't she think she really had to be married
EVELYN,NA,I don't know
JANICE,KS,H
EVELYN,NA,but she JANICD well the-
LINDA,AL,I don't know
JANICE,KS,The thing I didn't understand is
LINDA,AL,I don't know
JANICE,KS,why both families were so against Paul and Helen
LORI,KS,and then the rest of em X
JANICE,KS,and yen then Hen Henry and Margaret got married and there didn't seem to be any dissension there
LINDA,AL,Well the her
JANICE,KS,you know
LINDA,AL,his kids didn't like that
JANICE,KS,No his kids didn't like it but Henry was against XbutX
SUE,WI,But the
EVELYN,NA,well Paul had no future
SUE,WI,but the Yeah but that was
EVELYN,NA,Y_he had no money
LINDA,AL,Paul hadn't made his money um
EVELYN,NA,or anything and uh
LINDA,AL,Yeah
JANICE,KS,I thought it was mainly because of the difference in the families
NORA,KS,COUGH COUGH
JANICE,KS,though that they perhaps I misunderstood that
LINDA,AL,H I don't know
SUE,WI,I
LINDA,AL,I don't know that either
SUE,WI,I I agree more with Linda that that I think it was a situation where Paul H couldn't marry anybody
LINDA,AL,THROAT THROAT THROAT
SUE,WI,because he had to go overseas
JANICE,KS,He didn't have any money
SUE,WI,and make his f you know make his way in the world cause he couldn't support a woman
JANICE,KS,Mhm
SUE,WI,H And and maybe H those families see rather than the Basts who would get married whether they could support somebody or not H they strongly felt that you had to have a certain amount of money or or a certain future in order to end up
LORI,KS,position
SUE,WI,Yeah Position in order to have a wife
LORI,KS,ready to go
LIND,KS, Mm H Did Helen not have enough money to support them I wonder MANY MURMUR_AGREEMENT
LINDA,AL,Why couldn't Helen have just supported them
SUE,WI,Well I think that that was
LORI,KS,X that wasn't X
SUE,WI,they they wouldn't have allowed that
LINDA,AL,That's not a
LORI,KS,The Wilcoxes wouldn't X have X>
SUE,WI,That wouldn't have been alright H
LORI,KS,Look at Missis Wilcox XX
SUE,WI,according to the Wilcoxes
EVELYN,NA,the the the their code of honor Remember the uh
SUE,WI,Yeah
EVELYN,NA,strong English honor that they uh that Charles had to defend
PATTY,KS,X men would take care of them X
EVELYN,NA,You know
PATTY,KS,Right

LINDA,AL,Tibby wasn't there
SUE,WI,When when he they at the wedding see is when Helen uh conceived and so then shortly thereafter she me went away She went to like Germany
JANICE,KS,Germany
SUE,WI,or some place like that And she stayed in Germany
LORI,KS,Okay
LINDA,AL,Oh
SUE,WI,<X until X>
LORI,KS,<X friend of t X>
JANICE,KS,but that wasn't Margaret's wedding that was Evie's wedding That was before they got married
SUE,WI,Okay
LINDA,AL,Yeah That's right
SUE,WI,That was before Margaret even got married
LINDA,AL,Right
SUE,WI,So by the time Margaret gets married
JANICE,KS,THROAT Maybe they didn't <X live there the whole time X>
SUE,WI,Helen's pregnant and she's away somewhere
PATTY,KS,Tibby was gone
SUE,WI,because she isn't
EVELYN,NA,Yeah
SUE,WI,She's hiding
JANICE,KS,COUGH I see
SUE,WI,Essentially
DIANE,MN,SNIFF
LOIS,MO,Isn't it also basically a woman's the women are much more developed characters than the men
JANICE,KS,COUGH COUGH
LOIS,MO,And the men tend to be
LINDA,AL,Mhm
LOIS,MO,not such good people
LINDA,AL,Yeah I think so
KIM,MN,Isn't that interesting
PATTY,KS,Weak
KIM,MN,an that he would write that way if he was a homosexual
DIANE,MN,Except he was raised by his mother
LOIS,MO,X I don't know that X everybody agrees with that
DIANE,MN,and
LOIS,MO,but
DIANE,MN,aunt and so on
LORI,KS,Yeah so the the mo
KIM,MN,X pardon X
LORI,KS,the mothers have always been uh women figures in his life were so strong obviously
EVELYN,NA,Mhm
KIM,MN,Bu but but the fellow
LORI,KS,X isn't that what you're saying X
KIM ,KS,ibby is was isn't that is name He but he was such a wimpy H NANCY Mhm sure
KIM,MN,physically weak uh person Uh
EVELYN,NA,they all had asthma
LORI,KS,<X I wouldn't know who- they always X Hm
EVELYN,NA,and uh
LORI,KS,and Paul wasn't
EVELYN,NA,even living on the farm they all had uh
LORI,KS,Hm even Charles wasn't
PATTY,KS,TSK H Diane
EVELYN,NA,what was it hay fever or asthma or something X XXXXX
LINDA,AL,Yes
PATTY,KS,Diane started to say something about Out of Africa
LINDA,AL,Yes
DIANE,MN,Well you're talking about the woman having the money and why th m a man couldn't
LINDA,AL,Mhm Mhm
LORI,KS,Marry her
DIANE,MN,marry the
LINDA,AL,Mhm
DIANE,MN,y yeah in Out of Africa I think is about this same time period Or may well maybe it's s second world war H But Isak Dinesen
LORI,KS,later
DIANE,MN,the heroine of out of Africa is Danish but she's the one with money and she ends up a H the brother of the person that she's in love with marries her
LINDA,AL,Yeah yeah
DIANE,MN,because he has no money no family money but she has money H and she has no way to get a husband so they agree to get married because he will then have access to her money and title and she'll have a husband H So it was done my point of all that was X
DIANE,MN,that it was sometimes done H that a woman of means married a man of no means as uh an arrangement for what ever reason
LINDA,AL,TSK H Yeah I
DIANE,MN,and so it could have been that this
LINDA,AL,I guess
DIANE,MN,that her money could have been the s source of marriage if they'd wanted it to be
LINDA,AL,That's to me uh uh kind of a m not taken care of very well in the book I I guess I don't know why they didn't
DIANE,MN,Yeah
LINDA,AL,why that was such a no no H
DIANE,MN,And I didn't realize Forster grew up with money That sort of mixed me all up now too because
LINDA,AL,Mhm
DIANE,MN,it sounded to me like he hadn't and
LINDA,AL,Mhm
DIANE,MN,X yeah X H I have a question about England in nineteen ten too Which shows that my lack of history H Was England the strong world power in nineteen ten still The w empire English the sun never sets on the English empire
EVELYN,NA,Tha that was where uh
LINDA,AL,Mhm
EVELYN,NA,a a Wilcox made his money Wasn't it In s what was it Some kind of trade in uh I g I've forgotten what it was

EVELYN,NA,Uh was it
JANICE,KS,he had I think he had rubber tr plantations
EVELYN,NA,rubber plantations X XXXX

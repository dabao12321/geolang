TAMMY,OH,Well um TSK I wanted to say I'm really happy with the stuff I got now
BRAD,CA,Good Good
TAMMY,OH,H X And I'm X> really basically I'm back for a tape deck
BRAD,CA,Oh okay
TAMMY,OH,So um one of my thoughts is that um TSK well I want a tape deck that's gonna sound about you know as good as it can
BRAD,CA,Okay
TAMMY,OH,and I think I want a tape deck with two places for two tapes so I can copy
BRAD,CA,Okay
TAMMY,OH,H but I've never done this before I X don't X know much about tapes I mean I h
BRAD,CA,Okay
TAMMY,OH,I have a boombox you know ordinary sort of thing
BRAD,CA,Sure
TAMMY,OH,H So I wonder if you would suggest that this Luxman is the is w one of the things you'd wanted me to think about
BRAD ,OH,m TSK the uh TSK Would you you would want the the ability uh of the double cassette deck just purely for H taping from one tape to the other That's its main purpose In fact I wouldn't know what other purpose it would have
BRAD,CA,Oh okay The other benefit is is if H you can load up two tapes in it like let's say two ninety minute tapes of music
TAMMY,OH,Unhunh I see
BRAD,CA,H And you can set a switch on it
TAMMY,OH,I see
BRAD,CA,where it will continually play
TAMMY,OH,Okay Okay
BRAD,CA,all four sides of two tapes
TAMMY,OH,I see That's probably not gonna happen
BRAD,CA,Okay
TAMMY,OH,No It's mainly for copying
BRAD,CA,TSK Okay
TAMMY,OH,So
BRAD,CA,And the tapes you'd be copying uh are they gonna be straight music
TAMMY,OH,Mmostly
BRAD,CA,Okay
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,Okay
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,So you are gonna want H or desire a pretty decent uh copy of your original tape
TAMMY,OH,Mhm right
BRAD,CA,Okay H Um
TAMMY,OH,And the originals will be from music lovers you know who probably have H pretty good systems Not
BRAD,CA,Okay
TAMMY,OH,I'm we're not talking stratosphere
BRAD,CA,Sure
TAMMY,OH,P But P
BRAD,CA,Sure
TAMMY,OH,Anyway
BRAD,CA,Okay
TAMMY,OH,THROAT
BRAD,CA,Um because on a um TSK a tape deck like that you realize that you're not gonna be able to get a copy that's you know
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,as perfect as
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,H the original source was
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,or even as that tape was
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,There is gonna be some loss
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,in the generation of making that copy
TAMMY,OH,mhm TSK
BRAD,CA,H And
TAMMY,OH,Is there a way to avoid that loss I mean how
BRAD,CA,TSK
TAMMY,OH,X
BRAD,CA,Well you're you're gonna have that loss just H because of all the different things involved
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,f from taking it from one tape and putting it on the other tape
TAMMY,OH,Right Right
BRAD,CA,There's a lot of things in the signal path there
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,H
TAMMY,OH,So you're you're bound to lose something
BRAD,CA,Yeah It's not huge
TAMMY,OH,No matter what
BRAD,CA,you know it may be ten percent
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,or five percent
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,or something like that
TAMMY,OH,Right Right
BRAD,CA,H Uh which is a small amount and TSK you'll st still be able to enjoy the COUGH the music H and the message it's trying to H bring across
TAMMY,OH,Mhm mhm mhm okay
BRAD,CA,So
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,I don't see a problem in that H Um the other thing I realize is H uh think about how much of the time you're gonna be doing that
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,Because of You are paying a decent premium to have that convenience
TAMMY,OH,mhm mhm mhm TSK H so what kind of price difference are we talking about Suppose I just get one tape
BRAD,CA,TSK Oh okay H
TAMMY,OH,H And let my friends copy tapes for me and
BRAD,CA,Okay
TAMMY,OH,H yeah
BRAD,CA,um
TAMMY,OH,<X Right X>
BRAD,CA,like let's say there would be about
TAMMY,OH,THROAT
BRAD,CA,um Hx TSK couple different steps H Okay
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,one would be H a single cassette deck
TAMMY,OH,THROAT
BRAD,CA,H um that would TSK uh play the tape Hx H you know and after side A's done then you have to take the tape out and flip it over and play side B
TAMMY,OH,Okay Okay
BRAD,CA,H Okay
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,that would be your first level
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,H And Luxman has a great cassette deck to fill those needs
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,H And um
TAMMY,OH,THROAT
BRAD,CA,TSK H all of their cassette decks come with a five year parts and labor warranty Hx so the quality's
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,you know put into them Uh
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,They really put a lot into them to be able to give that kind of warranty
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,H and um TSK they're pretty conservative in their uh specifications where what they say their cassette decks will do they will y usually out perform that
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,And with the unit you already have the receiver that has the full remote control
TAMMY,OH,TSK Right
BRAD,CA,H all the units uh you're looking at here H will uh TSK go along with that
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,and um TSK as far as the remote control funtions go
TAMMY,OH,right
BRAD,CA,Where the remote control will control the decks
TAMMY,OH,Right Right Okay
BRAD,CA,H The decks come with
TAMMY,OH,THROAT
BRAD,CA,what's called a DIN cable and that plugs into the unit you have now
TAMMY,OH,Mhm right
BRAD,CA,H okay this is the kay one eleven
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,TSK This would be I guess you'd say the entry level
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,H to integrate into your system
TAMMY,OH,okay
BRAD,CA,H Um TSK this gives you a lot of pluses that most people's basic decks don't have
TAMMY,OH,Hm
BRAD,CA,H Okay it has Dolby
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,which as you know that's a circuit to cut the tape hiss H without cutting the high frequencies
TAMMY,OH,right Right
BRAD,CA,H And um regular Dolby is Dolby B That's like um
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,H when you buy tapes at the Wherehouse they're in Dolby
TAMMY,OH,right THROAT
BRAD,CA,H Um TSK in addition to that it gives you Dolby C
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,H When you're making your own tapes at home like let's say from the CD
TAMMY,OH,hm Mhm
BRAD,CA,H making a tape to play back on this tape deck
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,you're gonna wanna record it in Dolby C
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,That's gonna sound sonically superior
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,H Um or if friends are recording tapes in Dolby C then you'll be able to play it back and it'll sound right
TAMMY,OH,Hm Okay
BRAD,CA,H Okay so if something's recorded in Dolby B you wanna play it in Dolby B Dolby C you wanna play it in Dolby C H You don't want to
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,H mix and match Uh
TAMMY,OH,okay
BRAD,CA,the It doesn't sound quite right
TAMMY,OH,Nkay
BRAD,CA,H So this gives you that
TAMMY,OH,hunh
BRAD,CA,H it also gives you what's called HX Pro
TAMMY,OH,Okay mhm
BRAD,CA,Which is a feature usually only found in rh really expensive cassette decks
TAMMY,OH,Mm Hm
BRAD,CA,H And that i is TSK an improvement in the recording section of it
TAMMY,OH,Hm
BRAD,CA,H and it allows you to record a little bit
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,um higher record level so you hear less tape hiss
TAMMY,OH,mhm mhm
BRAD,CA,H and also has a little bit more um high frequency response H
TAMMY,OH,Hm Mhm
BRAD,CA,Okay so this one here you're looking at three hundred eighty dollars
TAMMY,OH,mhm hm Mhm
BRAD,CA,Okay H and um TSK from there the next step for what you're looking at H would be the kay one ten H Okay the kay one ten basically has all functions that we just talked about on the on the kay one eleven
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,H um
TAMMY,OH,THROAT
BRAD,CA,H with the addition of H the convenience feature of having auto reverse
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,TSK H And that's nice just like in the car
TAMMY,OH,X
BRAD,CA,Where
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,H it will play side B after side A is finished automatically
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,Where you don't have to get up and flip the tape
TAMMY,OH,H okay
BRAD,CA,H The other thing about it is you can flip the tape over at any point in the middle
TAMMY,OH,Mhm right
BRAD,CA,TSK Uh H and the other thing y let's say if you're entertaining you can put in a ninety minute tape
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,put it on continuous auto reverse
TAMMY,OH,m mhm
BRAD,CA,H have a recording of your favorite songs
TAMMY,OH,right Mhm
BRAD,CA,for a party
TAMMY,OH,right
BRAD,CA,a dinner party whatever
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,H and play side A then side B then side A side B
TAMMY,OH,Yeah that's good
BRAD,CA,it'll just go forever
TAMMY,OH,That's good
BRAD,CA,Okay
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,H Um
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,H so that's what it gives you in the kay one ten
TAMMY,OH,THROAT mhm
BRAD,CA,H TSK Now the dual or double cassette deck H that Luxman offers H is basically a um TSK double version of the kay one ten
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,H And they call it the kay one ten double-u
TAMMY,OH,TSK Okay
BRAD,CA,H And
TAMMY,OH,So what's the price difference here
BRAD,CA,Oh okay I'm sorry the
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,the kay one ten is four hundred eighty dollars
TAMMY,OH,Alright
BRAD,CA,H and the kay one ten double-u is five hundred eighty dollars
TAMMY,OH,Mhm okay
BRAD,CA,H Okay X So you paid X a hundred dollar premium for auto reverse H then you're paying another hundred dollars to have
TAMMY,OH,Yeah right
BRAD,CA,double cassette deck that's auto reverse
TAMMY,OH,Okay Mhm okay
BRAD,CA,H Um the convenience on this is obvious
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,H Where um they even have
TAMMY,OH,THROAT
BRAD,CA,um you know buttons set up for
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,H dubbing or copying
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,from one tape deck to the other
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,H Um TSK so it's really set up to be just cranking out
TAMMY,OH,hm
BRAD,CA,H uh copies
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,H Now the other thing is it has a feature where it will do it in half the time
TAMMY,OH,hm
BRAD,CA,Or high speed dubbing
TAMMY,OH,Hm Hm Hm Hm
BRAD,CA,H Which is sometimes nice so it doesn't take the whole period of time
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,H To make your copy
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,H And it will continue making the copy you know from side A then and it'll flip over
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,and to side B H Um TSK so we we've talked about it how how it has the dubbing speed select buttons
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,so you can make a a high speed copy
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,H um H The other thing that sets this apart from a lot of other dual decks is it has a separate Dolby button H for each cassette deck
TAMMY,OH,STIFLED_SNEEZE Mhm
BRAD,CA,Ge uh gesundheit
TAMMY,OH,Hx Thank you SNIFF Hx yeah
BRAD,CA,Um where a lot of units will
TAMMY,OH,Hm
BRAD,CA,H just have a Dolby setting
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,and that's the same for both decks
TAMMY,OH,TSK I see I see
BRAD,CA,H But there may be a situation where a friend of yours
TAMMY,OH,Yeah Mhm
BRAD,CA,H who's a real audiophile made uh
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,a real premium tape for you
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,recorded in Dolby C
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,H Well you wanna record it in Dolby B so you can play it back in your Walkman
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,and in your automobile's cassette player
TAMMY,OH,mhm mhm
BRAD,CA,H Uh in that scenario H you're gonna want to play it back in Dolby C but record it in Dolby B H
TAMMY,OH,Yeah Okay
BRAD,CA,Okay
TAMMY,OH,That's <X good X>
BRAD,CA,So this gives you that convenience
TAMMY,OH,SNIFF Nkay
BRAD,CA,H Now the other thing is let's say H um that friend of yours came over for dinner with his prize tape
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,H and you had your prize tape
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,of of something else you could load them both up
TAMMY,OH,mhm mhm
BRAD,CA,H put it on continuous
TAMMY,OH,
BRAD,CA,um
TAMMY,OH,unhunh
BRAD,CA,H auto reverse and it will play side A side B of one tape
TAMMY,OH,@@
BRAD,CA,go over to the other tape
TAMMY,OH,right
BRAD,CA,and play /sed ai/
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,side A then side B and it continually go forever
TAMMY,OH,right Okay
BRAD,CA,H Um
TAMMY,OH,Hunh
BRAD,CA,TSK which is kinda nice
TAMMY,OH,Wow
BRAD,CA,Now the other thing  you can do with this deck is
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,H in your system you can make a copy from tape to tape H while you're listening to something else
TAMMY,OH,BLOWS_NOSE
BRAD,CA,nkay
TAMMY,OH,Unhunh
BRAD,CA,so you could be listening to your CD
TAMMY,OH,right
BRAD,CA,while you're making a tape copy
TAMMY,OH,Right That's right Okay
BRAD,CA,H Um H the other thing you can do is H um TSK as I recall Hx one can listen to TSK H the tuner
TAMMY,OH,THROAT
BRAD,CA,so you could put on H KDB
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,or I I
TAMMY,OH,right
BRAD,CA,r there's one Matt likes I forget what it's called but anyhow
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,H um
TAMMY,OH,THROAT
BRAD,CA,or he wants to get KFAC I think it is
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,H Which is kind of tough Um H so you could be listening to the radio while taping a CD
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,You you know
TAMMY,OH,right
BRAD,CA,it allows you to do that
TAMMY,OH,Right Right Okay
BRAD,CA,Which H you have to pay attention to what you're doing
TAMMY,OH,Okay I know That's right Yeah
BRAD,CA,H yeah H but at least you have that flexibility
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,H And so it sounds like
TAMMY,OH,THROAT
BRAD,CA,from what you've told me H uh you know about you're desire to make good quality copies of tapes
TAMMY,OH,Mhm mhm
BRAD,CA,H this is gonna be the tape deck
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,that would fit your needs
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,TSK And integrate well with your system and
TAMMY,OH,TSK right
BRAD,CA,allow the remote to fully control it
TAMMY,OH,Okay Well what you've said helps me a lot I actually may I mean I don't do this so often And it may well be that I I'd do better just going back to one of these others
BRAD,CA,Mhm
TAMMY,OH,Um in
BRAD,CA,TSKH The oth-
TAMMY,OH,in fact I'm
BRAD,CA,the oth the other thing I was gonna say is is it H do you have um TSK if you had some other type of quality cassette deck
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,H Even if it was a H H unf
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,one in the office or uh
TAMMY,OH,mhm TSK yeah
BRAD,CA,a portable or something like that
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,H I could somehow hook it up into your system
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,So you could tape from it
TAMMY,OH,right Right
BRAD,CA,H to one of these
TAMMY,OH,Right okay that's possible
BRAD,CA,H And H the the prices I gave you were the uh Luxman suggested prices
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,"H since you've bought  ouple pieces here"
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,and also been through the fire I'm sure we can H work something else out for you
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,I don't know
TAMMY,OH,okay
BRAD,CA,H how well Hx h let's see here H Hx um the kay one eleven Hx H which is the the basic one
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,but h I don't When I say basic I mean basic in their line
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,it's still very good
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,H uh you'd be looking at three hundred forty-nine dollars
TAMMY,OH,THROAT nkay
BRAD,CA,H The uh TSK let's see here H the kay one ten
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,uh we could do four hundred and forty-five
TAMMY,OH,TSK right
BRAD,CA,H and the kay one ten double-u uh we could do five thirty nine
TAMMY,OH,mhm TSK okay Well that looks great
BRAD,CA,And I th I believe H there's one that we didn't talk about and that's the kay one twelve
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,H Okay and the kay one twelve is basically H the audiophile's dream cassette deck
TAMMY,OH,
BRAD,CA,Okay
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,it's a H it's a single cassette and it's single direction
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,where it doesn't flip over by itself
TAMMY,OH,right
BRAD,CA,H What sets it apart is it has three discrete heads
TAMMY,OH,hunh
BRAD,CA,Okay H and this will make a superior tape copy
TAMMY,OH,Hm
BRAD,CA,H um or a superior tape period H Um
TAMMY,OH,Hm
BRAD,CA,TSK because it has three heads
TAMMY,OH,Hm
BRAD,CA,H And what it does is that it has a separate head for record a separate head for play H
TAMMY,OH,Hm
BRAD,CA,Where most decks have a combination record play head
TAMMY,OH,TSK Unhunh
BRAD,CA,H And um TSK this also has some adjustments on it uh such as bias fine trim
TAMMY,OH,Hm
BRAD,CA,H uh which allows you to H tailor the cassette deck's electronics H to the specific tape you're using
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,H So obviously you can see there's
TAMMY,OH,right
BRAD,CA,a b a bit more involved with it
TAMMY,OH,Yeah Yeah
BRAD,CA,H For the purist this is the way to go YWN Here you're looking at six hundred dollars YWN
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,H
TAMMY,OH,Okay THROAT Right Okay well this is very helpful H Let me ask you one other thing
BRAD,CA,X
TAMMY,OH,Suppose that H I wanna use this tape deck to record um conversation Like we do in X in X linguistics Between Matt and me or something like that
BRAD,CA,TSK H Okay
TAMMY,OH,Then how does it work Let's say go back to the kay one ten
BRAD,CA,H Uh
TAMMY,OH,Or the one
BRAD,CA,there's one deck here I think that's set up for that
TAMMY,OH,or the one el eleven
BRAD,CA,Let's take a look here H The kay one ten
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,TSK H has provisions for microphones on the front
TAMMY,OH,unhunh
BRAD,CA,H And it's one of the few cassette decks
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,made for the consumer hi fi market today
TAMMY,OH,@Hx
BRAD,CA,that do have that
TAMMY,OH,okay
BRAD,CA,H And so H you can plug in one microphone
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,TSK uh where it has a position uh that's mono
TAMMY,OH,Mh-hunh
BRAD,CA,H and it will record it on both tracks of it
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,and then if you want
TAMMY,OH,hm
BRAD,CA,you can plug in two mics H and it senses when you plug in the second mic
TAMMY,OH,Hm TSK okay
BRAD,CA,and so it'll record in stereo
TAMMY,OH,TSK Okay
BRAD,CA,H And then it has a record level on it
TAMMY,OH,Hmhm
BRAD,CA,so you can adjust the record level
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,dependent on how loud you're talking
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,H and then also the type of tape you're using
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,and the level you want on the tape
TAMMY,OH,hm Hm
BRAD,CA,TSK Uh H so the kay one ten would be set up for that
TAMMY,OH,Hunh
BRAD,CA,H Any of the other um cassette decks here
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,H TSK the kay one eleven has it too I Take-
TAMMY,OH,hunh
BRAD,CA,I I take it back
TAMMY,OH,Huh
BRAD,CA,I didn't think the kay ele lev one eleven did
TAMMY,OH,Unhunh unhunh
BRAD,CA,H Okay it's the it's the dual one that doesn't
TAMMY,OH,okay
BRAD,CA,The dual one does not have those provisions H now that doesn't mean that it cannot be done
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,H What has to happen then is H uh one TSK hooks up H a
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,a separate outboard piece called a microphone amp
TAMMY,OH,okay
BRAD,CA,H Okay and so what happens is your mic runs into it
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,H and then it plugs into your receiver
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,into one of its inputs
TAMMY,OH,TSK okay
BRAD,CA,H And so one of your inputs on your receiver
TAMMY,OH,THROAT
BRAD,CA,H let's say tape two TODD <YELL X Paul X>
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,would actually be a microphone TODD run run
TAMMY,OH,mhm TODD Yeah
BRAD,CA,And so you would hit that TODD Yeah
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD ,OH,nd that would um TODD #Paul saved my ass YELL>
BRAD,CA,go over
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,um
TAMMY,OH,nkay
BRAD,CA,into your tape deck if you wanted to record a tape
TAMMY,OH,Right Right Okay H So um m
BRAD,CA,TSK So the kay one ten which is the single auto reverse
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,has the mic provisions
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,H the kay one eleven H has the mic provisions
TAMMY,OH,And so's the kay one Okay Great Okay
BRAD,CA,The b the benefit of the one ten The big benefit is the auto reverse
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,H Um
TAMMY,OH,I'm one of these weird people that has trouble with auto reverse
BRAD,CA,TSK oh yeah
TAMMY,OH,I don't know why The first time I mean this is the first time I've had it on my boombox H And for some reason maybe I just have to learn when I put the tape in I never know which direction it's gonna go H So I have a hard time finding H
BRAD,CA,What you want
TAMMY,OH,making it play what I want it to play
BRAD,CA,Okay H The way it usually works is
TAMMY,OH,H H
BRAD,CA,H um
TAMMY,OH,H
BRAD,CA,the side of the tape that's out Or facing you that label side
TAMMY,OH,Mhm mhm
BRAD,CA,H TSK corresponds with the arrow H that will point to the right There's usually two little arrows that will light up
TAMMY,OH,nkay Yeah
BRAD,CA,telling you which direction it's playing
TAMMY,OH,right Right
BRAD,CA,H Okay the arrow that points to the right
TAMMY,OH,I see
BRAD,CA,is H the label side of the tape that's facing you
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,That you can see
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,Okay that's the way it usually works
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,H Now the other thing that throws people off is
TAMMY,OH, H
BRAD,CA,H fast forward and rewind H
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,will vary depending on which side of the tape you're on
TAMMY,OH,right Right Right
BRAD,CA,Okay that's what throws people off
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,all the time
TAMMY,OH,Yeah H I just um I'll I'll work on getting used to that But I just might go with the H single you know the one that I have to turn it over
BRAD,CA,HI Oh
TAMMY,OH,I mean
BRAD,CA,you know that's fine HI
TAMMY,OH,H you know
BRAD,CA,That's fine Um H TSK
TAMMY,OH,H
BRAD,CA,I'm trying I mean I had a couple recently uh Bodeckers uh got the kay one eleven and and they love it
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,They don't play tapes that much
TAMMY,OH,Yeah That's the same with me too Yeah I'm really into CD's now
BRAD,CA,Unhunh yeah
TAMMY,OH,So
BRAD,CA,But they have a couple of these box sets of uh
TAMMY,OH,SNIFF right
BRAD,CA,symphonies
TAMMY,OH,right
BRAD,CA,H and then I think they even have a couple books on tape
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,H and for that it's perfect
TAMMY,OH,right
BRAD,CA,You know it's probably w more than enough
TAMMY,OH,Right SNIFF
BRAD,CA,H
TAMMY,OH,TSK Right
BRAD,CA,Um I'm just trying to look and see what other differences there are
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,I I mean I really think those are the that's the big difference
TAMMY,OH,this is No this is great
BRAD,CA,Um TSK SING doo doo SING I believe yeah I think that's the basic difference is that auto reverse
TAMMY,OH,H Let me ask you do you sell microphones
BRAD,CA,TSK H
TAMMY,OH,Here
BRAD,CA,Uh we don't really JONATHAN SING Nya nya nya nya nya nya
TAMMY,OH,Kay
BRAD,CA,get into them
TAMMY,OH,Nkay
BRAD ,OH,m H we are JONATHAN Nya nya nya nya nya nya
BRAD ,OH,m JONATHAN You can't get me SING
BRAD,CA,connected with a distributor that does deal with them
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,H And so we we've gotten them for clients time to time JONATHAN Try to get me
TAMMY,OH,TSK Okay
BRAD,CA,H um H I think we have them available from Sony H And I'd really have to l research that a bit for you
TAMMY,OH,that's okay I I can follow through on that You have any idea how much a good
BRAD,CA,Okay
TAMMY,OH,H sort of um table mic would cost Um
BRAD,CA,Well um Hx you can get one
TAMMY,OH,THROAT
BRAD,CA,f ah s I would say I would expect to pay H TSK maybe f f forty dollars and up
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,I mean really the sky's the limit with microphones
TAMMY,OH,Right right
BRAD,CA,I mean you can get
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,n thousand dollar microphones
TAMMY,OH,THROAT Okay
BRAD,CA,But H um you would proba I would spend you know I wouldn't spend nineteen dollars
TAMMY,OH,Mhm mhm
BRAD,CA,I'd spend forty bucks
TAMMY,OH,yeah Yeah Okay
BRAD,CA,H and then maybe a little up above that
TAMMY,OH,Nkay mhm
BRAD,CA,H For what you wanna do I I don't ever see paying you know a couple hundred dollars
TAMMY,OH,mhm
BRAD,CA,that that would probably be
TAMMY,OH,right
BRAD,CA,f very overkill
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,So that kind of gives you an idea
TAMMY,OH,Mhm right
BRAD,CA,H
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,Um there's a place to look um called Sound Advice
TAMMY,OH,Yeah Alright
BRAD,CA,Okay there's a guy there named Wayne
TAMMY,OH,Yeah Okay
BRAD,CA,He's uh
TAMMY,OH,TSK that's a good idea
BRAD,CA,one of the principals there #Wayne
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,I think his name is Shaybeck
TAMMY,OH,Alright
BRAD,CA,Saybeck Shaybeck something like that And he's a really knowledgeable guy
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,he's been in the business for a long time
TAMMY,OH,great
BRAD,CA,H uh and they're good guys there
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,So that would be a a place to look at a mic
TAMMY,OH,TSK okay that'd be great Yeah H Um THROAT if we needed to d get a price on a tape r recorder that we lost See what we lost was a tape recorder not a tape deck H
BRAD,CA,Okay
TAMMY,OH,It was a fancy Uher That name rings a bell
BRAD,CA,Are y- Oh really It was
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,Oh gosh
TAMMY,OH,Right
BRAD,CA,Th that's
TAMMY,OH,
BRAD,CA,like
TAMMY,OH,But
BRAD,CA,considered H I mean there's a lot of different models of Uhers
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,H but uh they've always been considered H probably one of the finest portable cassette recorders
TAMMY,OH,mhm mhm yeah Right
BRAD,CA,H uh w our blue book usually shows the Uhers
TAMMY,OH,Yeah
BRAD,CA,Our older Uhers
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,So I could show you H what the blue book price was
TAMMY,OH,Then if I Nkay
BRAD,CA,H it's gonna be hard to d
TAMMY,OH,Okay
BRAD,CA,I don't know Uhers that well it's gonna be hard to determine
TAMMY,OH,Mhm
BRAD,CA,what would be a comparable H replacement today
TAMMY,OH,@I know Right Yeah
BRAD,CA,And that would be something you may wanna run by Wayne
TAMMY,OH,Okay Great Nkay H You don't sell that kind of thing here Right Cause this is an audio
BRAD,CA,That's right
TAMMY,OH,place
BRAD,CA,well I mean

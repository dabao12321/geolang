FRED,IL,Okay One large loan Hx renewed Hx a hundred ninety-seven thousand a hundred eighty dollars It's on Gerald and Pamela
JIM,IL,Okay
FRED,IL,They've paid they've reduced no problem He's handled his line of credit as agreed so it's pretty routine Joe
JOE,IL,P Okay P TSK H First loan request I have is an existing real estate mortgage that H will be refinanced into the secondary market of Fannie Mae H Customer is Gerry and Pamela Tucker H at sixty-one fifty-eight Main Street in Hillsdale Illinois H they're requesting eighty-four thousand dollars on a thirty-year Fannie Mae fixed rate loan H this would include the cost of doing the refinance appraisal title work and points
FRED,IL,Eighty-four
JOE,IL,H Eighty four even THROAT Their monthly payment of principle interest taxes and insurance H would be seven sixty-one eighty-nine based at the current thirty-year rate H They estimate the value of their home to be Hx one-hundred Hx and ten thousand dollars H We had an appraisal in nineteen ninety-one by a certified appraiser that indicates the value of the house was a hundred and three thousand dollars H Eighty percent of that would make it eighty-two four So H um in order to make them a loan for eighty-four thousand it must appraise for a hundred and five So that will be THROAT H will determine whether or not we can go the full eighty-four and whether they have to come up with some money out of pocket Their assets total one sixteen four seventeen H their liabilities Hx eighty three H their net worth thirty-one
FRED,IL,So all they owe is the house
JOE,IL,H Mhm H They um TSK
FRED,IL,T T T
JOE,IL,currently have a debt to income of twenty-eight over twenty-seven H and after the refinance they would have a debt to income of fifteen over twenty-three TSK H
JIM,IL,Where are they now I missed that They're fifteen over
JOE,IL,No They're currently twenty
FRED,IL,They can't be
JOE,IL,over twenty-seven I
FRED,IL,Oh okay Twenty
JOE,IL,Yeah Twenty over twenty-seven Yeah
FRED,IL,You can't even
JOE,IL,Twenty over tw
KURT,IL,XXXX
FRED,IL,You can't even read your writing
JOE,IL,I couldn't even read my f my own writing
FRED,IL,
JOE,IL,H It's twenty over twenty-seven
FRED,IL,H Okay
JOE,IL,H And after the refi it's fifteen over twenty-three
KURT,IL,What is acceptable pretty much uh what figures
JOE,IL,TSK H Twenty-eight over thirty-six is the maxes
KURT,IL,It's as high as it could go
JOE,IL,See so they're well within
KURT,IL,Okay I just wondered
JOE,IL,They're well within their debt to income
KURT,IL,I H always heard the figures and never did know what was high and
JOE,IL,Right
KURT,IL,low don't make any difference
JOE,IL,Yeah H Um
FRED,IL,So you said they're gonna be fifteen
JOE,IL,Mhm Fifteen over twenty-three so H their debt to income THROAT isn't a problem the H uh problem as I see it is the value of the house number one H and the second Hx matter at hand is that in nineteen eighty-seven H they had filed a chapter eleven H They had at the time a mortgage with us H They reaffirmed on that mortgage They were never late H We Hx uh After that discharge we even advanced them H money to purchase this house on Main st H Street here in Hillsdale and um TSK they have never missed a payment on that loan H I've also made them car loans that they've never missed a payment on Hx and um TSK according to Fannie Mae guidelines as long as they have H been discharged at least two years H and reestablished and paid as agreed H their credit obligations they would qualify for a Fannie Mae mortgage H With that in mind Hx um H I am moving that they app uh that we approve this loan request subject to H a uh certified appraisal of their home
FRED,IL,Do we have the discharge
JOE,IL,Yes I have a copy of it
FRED,IL,Mhm When was it
JOE,IL,It was discharged on November uh no Two twenty-three eighty-eight Discharge date was two twenty-three of eighty-eight
FRED,IL,When did they file Didn't you say they filed in eighty-seven
JOE,IL,Eleven of eighty-seven
FRED,IL,In eleven
JOE,IL,Mhm
JIM,IL,Three months Whew That's pretty fast
JOE,IL,Yeah
FRED,IL,What did they do
JOE,IL,H
FRED,IL,Dismiss it
JOE,IL,It was a business No it was a business uh bankruptcy and H it was pretty cut and dried they just were eliminating the business um debt H and apparently nobody objected to the the bankruptcy Since they reaffirmed with their secured creditors H All the debt that was charged that was bank filed bankruptcy against was H unsecured creditors
FRED,IL,And they discharged em before they even performed or anything
JOE,IL,TSK Yeah in a three mon I guess so in a p three-month period of time cause here's the
FRED,IL,No I I just it's unusual that they don't require em to you know usually they put em on a two-year or three-year plan or something
JOE,IL,Mhm H See the from what I I gathered is the unsecured creditors got nothing H and the secured creditors just carried on their payment history as agreed As originally set forth in their contracts
FRED,IL,X But you know X usually the plan'll provide some period of time of protection
JOE,IL,Oh I Yeah Mhm
FRED,IL,But if we've got uh
JOE,IL,for those unsecured creditors
FRED,IL,Yeah But if we've got the discharge
JIM,IL,Yeah
FRED,IL,Okay Well in that case
JIM,IL,That's hard to believe because it says that notice of joint discharge of joint debtors it it appears the persons named above filed a petition commencing
FRED,IL,Yeah
JIM,IL,joint case under title eleven
JOE,IL,mhm
JIM,IL,on November twenty-third of nineteen eighty-seven And that an order of relief has been entered no complaint objecting to the discharge of the debtors was filed within the time fixed by the court
FRED,IL,Yeah
JOE,IL,Yeah
JIM,IL,H Uh what was that Ten minutes Or
FRED,IL,
KURT,IL,
JOE,IL,Yeah
JIM,IL,And um
FRED,IL,Yeah See I don't know how they got it done that fast
JIM,IL,and and that they're um
FRED,IL,X Hell X we can't even get to court in three months
JOE,IL,I know
KURT,IL,
JIM,IL,Hm
KURT,IL,SNIFF
JOE,IL,That's ridiculous
JIM,IL,That
JOE,IL,H I have a X lean X>
JIM,IL,And it's dated February twenty-third nineteen eighty-eight
JOE,IL,Mhm
JIM,IL,H
FRED,IL,Okay
JIM,IL,That's uh
FRED,IL,I mean H
JIM,IL,three months
FRED,IL,That's all I just Yeah That's what I was just I assumed it would've been like eighty uh ninety-two or something
JOE,IL,Mhm
FRED,IL,you know
JIM,IL,Yeah What
FRED,IL,the five
JIM,IL,What actually happened to them H was she opened a franchise And it was a franchise of doing packaging sending m uh from a mall basis
FRED,IL,Unhunh
JIM,IL,H uh packaging gift wrapping and shipping
KURT,IL,shipping it
JOE,IL,COUGH COUGH
JIM,IL,Well what happened
JOE,IL,COUGH
JIM,IL,They should have gotten into the business hindsight's twenty twenty They should've gotten into the business in let's say August H and then they would've had a Christmas season There was a t It got to be real complicated H and they didn't get in until February Well February they had nothing to do and and I think they
FRED,IL,Yeah
JIM,IL,They hung in there for H a year and a half And they just couldn't couldn't see end to it
FRED,IL,XX
KURT,IL,February nobody's shipping anything 
FRED,IL,I'll s I'll second then Joe
KURT,IL,H
JOE,IL,Okay
JIM,IL,So it's moved and seconded to uh
JOE,IL,TSK H approve that loan subject to the uh appraisal by a certified appraisal
FRED,IL,And the max is eighty-four
JOE,IL,Mhm
FRED,IL,Okay
JIM,IL,Okay TSK All in favor aye
FRED,IL,Aye
KURT,IL,Aye
JOE,IL,Aye
JIM,IL,Opposed same sign Motion carries
FRED,IL,SIGH Is that the only one Hx
JOE,IL,TSK H That's the only loan I have
FRED,IL,Okay I got one small one The only reason it's in here is because the borrowers already have three-hundred three thousand borrowed so it has to be approved by the board H but if we if Jim and Kurt approve it today that'd be two and then I'll have to call two more Uh they wanna borrow forty f Well Dave wants to borrow forty-five hundred dollars to finish paying off the renovation and upgrade necessary on the daycare And he had initially thought what he borrowed would do it and then he borrowed some money from his uncle and he wants to repay his uncle and get that out of the way H He wants to set it up on a year uh it would be secured via three vehicles um you know his debt to income is relatively high but his income's going up the daycare is scheduled to open a week after the fifth So around the twelfth to fifteenth of January he thought he's been H he thought he was already opened and then they came back in and told him he couldn't open Cause there was articles in the paper and they showed kids at the daycare and he had his ads out and everything H but he didn't have all the i's dotted and t's crossed and state came back in and said well no you can't really do that So H one group of state people the people that do all the do the testing for electrical and safety and stuff have been there and now the state H inspector's got to come in I guess they just look at the quality of the facility Not necessarily the wiring plumbing and heating but H is it clean and is it safe and that sort of thing H They're supposed to be there the fifth and he said that the lady told him that it usually takes a week for them to send a report in and for their license to come back H So he anticipates that they'll be open no later than the twelfth to fifteenth H he gave me some numbers I can't remember they've got like H thirteen or fourteen kids they're already taking care of mostly out of their house until they can get em moved down there and then they've got eight or nine more H So they fully expect income to exceed the projection but right now they don't have any income other than from his job So H uh XXX
JIM,IL,That's fairly large scale What And he's gonna have twenty-five people
JOE,IL,TSK H The building is
JIM,IL,or something
JOE,IL,Yeah At l east twenty-five .. children
FRED,IL,Yeah
JIM,IL,Twenty-five
FRE,IL, See they're e- Yeah They're expecting that many fairly quickly And then he hopes to get up around fifty
FRED,IL,See they're looking at four people plus
JOE,IL,H I've gone through the building
FRED,IL,you know plus his wife
JOE,IL,and it is uh a r very very nicely done operation I mean there's nothing H shoddy about the workmanship or the quality of the material or H the cleanliness of the of the building XX
JIM,IL,Is it attached onto a storage facility
JOE,IL,H No It's a separate building
JIM,IL,Oh it's free-standing building
FRED,IL,Yeah
JOE,IL,Separate building
FRED,IL,See it's a
JIM,IL,They
FRED,IL,It's a building his dad had where he was where he had his
JOE,IL,his cabinet shop
JIM,IL,Okay
FRED,IL,shop and
JIM,IL,Okay
FRED,IL,And was living in it and they converted the living quarters and all that into this thing H It's like anything when you're dealing with th you know regulators and the state they H you know he said they got two ladies for nine counties and they There's a lot of this going on and they can only get to so many So H I would move since it's secured for forty-five hundred it's on a twelve-month repayment which is relatively short H I would move that we advance the funds
KURT,IL,I'll second it Except they owe pretty much don't they
FRED,IL,Three-hundred three thousand and some odd dollars But he's always serviced I mean he's never been late he's always paid as agreed H uh and they do have the income it just right now the income doesn't Well I say they have it H Once the daycare gets up to twenty people they'll have enough income to
KURT,IL,Mhm
FRED,IL,H They'll fall back under the forty percent But right now they're over the forty because we st can't show any income from the daycare H Um but you know it it you know I feel comfortable that it's there and like I say he's always serviced debt as agreed and and his overall debt is working down it's just quite a bit of debt
KURT,IL,H You just I guess you can't say too much if they're H paying on time Uh uh
FRED,IL,Yeah
KURT,IL,and
FRED,IL,And I think they're about to the point
KURT,IL,as long as everything works out good
JOE,IL,H
KURT,IL,H
FRED,IL,"Yeah I think if th you know th th He's already talking if this thing goes like they think it is next fall he's wanting to start looking at expanding that storage facility H It's one of those things I think there's they're always gonna have H quite a bit of debt so long as cash flow'll keep up with it Cause you know he's that's kind of their H you know he's looking at that as his retirement income and an investment and this whole bit, you know like some of the people do here"
JIM,IL,Well it's been moved and seconded um to approve but that we can't really disburse on that That due to his size H of the loan
JOE,IL,until we have all
JIM,IL,They need f-  f-
KURT,IL,all the board members
JOE,IL,majority of board member
FRED,IL,Yeah
JIM,IL,Four uh f At least two more board members because I'm voting
FRED,IL,Yeah
JIM,IL,all in I'm voting in favor of it
FRED,IL,In favor
JIM,IL,and
FRED,IL,Yeah X See I was X
JIM,IL,since you seconded it I assume so are you
FRED,IL,Yeah
KURT,IL,Yeah
FRED,IL,So see I've got two and then I'll try to H I'll get hold of two more I was gonna see Wilbur but he didn't s Dave didn't get in here until after he was gone so that's the only one I have
JIM,IL,Any other loans
JOE,IL,No other loans to be discussed
JIM,IL,I got a couple things here but uh we'll um the one is in regard to the retail nondeposit investment H just to kind of bring us up to speed H m Matt has tentatively accepted our offer for employment but since he's going to be a dual employee th you really don't need to put this in the minutes XX
JOE,IL,Hm Okay
JIM,IL,I'll I'll c I'll catch up the board up to speed I just want us to know because H it has some loan relevance H Uh he was interviewed by LCL Larry Harb interviewed him over the telephone yesterday Hx and Larry called me this morning that's who had called about seven-thirty and said everything went fine H Um TSK what what we have set up is Matt's going up to Chicago H at LCL's office on uh for Monday evening Tuesday H and Wednesday training The f The Monday evening and Tuesday training H will be very specific for him H their workflow their forms he'll get to meet these people H On Wednesday then he'll be in a little bit of a larger group H there may be four or five other asset managers with him H discussing sails motivations and H and and sales approaches and strategies H Larry said Ph he doesn't know how Matt's gonna plug into us philosophically and how well he's known in the area He said that's our decision Of which I you know I'm comfortable with H I wanted Larry to tell me how he thinks he's gonna do plugging into the selling and he said oh you he should be he should do very well So I I'm um tho that looks good H What I did kind of H in regard to that was and I don't have this date finalized but H s I'm trying to go maybe the second week of January H to have a representative of Bankers Systems H come THUMP here THUMP to do some specialized training within the qualified retirement plan area Matt needs H Matt needs an understanding of not a detailed understanding but how all these qualified plans work H so that he w can have so he understands how H his products plug into the H to the self-directed IRAs SEPs and the like H We also it would do us good to know what products we can offer H under those qualified retirement plans H So uh R Ray Galino I I believe is his name is H supposed to come down I haven't set up a date H but he'll be here on a f for a day and I wanted him to talk with Matt H Vivian myself and sometime during the day to the two of you H Because as loan officers H you have a good H handle on borrowers and and can kind of tell them of these SEPs and some of the other products H Uh we've kind of hesitated in in offering those X H
JIM,IL,H well we have not offered the self-directed
JOE,IL,Hm
JIM,IL,H Offering the self-directed we're getting is simply H we need to get a dif fifty different forms Instead of H called an IRA it's called an IRA SD for self-directed And then that will allow people H to if they don't want all their funds in a bank CD as as are custodial IRA arrangements See the existing IRA says H all those funds have to be in First National Bank of Hillsdale H The self-directed the the participant signs a H an investment direction or where where he directs the investments They sign the form and then you invest in whatever they want to
JOE,IL,Yeah XX XXX
JIM,IL,H Uh the what How that works like with the SEPs H the SEP has a vehicle has to be connected to the IRA So we take the SEP off the shelf and then if the person wants that money put into a bank CD H then we just use our custodial IRA forms H If they want a self-directed i SEP H you take the same SEP form off H but you're using a different H IRA You're not using the custodial IRA arrangement
FRED,IL,Oh okay
JIM,IL,H An SEP must have an IRA H attached to it So that
FRED,IL,So the IRAs all fit in the same plan They're just different ch boxes checked off of this overall plan And that the overall plan is what you're talking about goes back that's what the IRS has blessed
JIM,IL,Right They
FRED,IL,is the framework and so long as you stay within the framework in some combination you're okay
JIM,IL,Exactly H So I I had talked with with Rick uh Brady today
FRED,IL,THROAT
JIM,IL,H and he's gonna send me those forms so we can take a look at em H The other The thing which makes it a little more complicated but H it's really not a cost H it's kind of a s flip-flop in that H he recommended we don't try and do the account maintenance on those self-directed IRAs ourselves H Because of how complicated the law is in all this
FRED,IL,Mhm
JIM,IL,so
FRED,IL,Mhm
JIM,IL,H I mean coincidentally Banker Systems offers a comprehensive account H maintainance services
FRED,IL,
JOE,IL,You're kidding
JIM,IL,Isn't that XX
FRED,IL,@@
JOE,IL,Well isn't that a surprise
FRED,IL, 
JIM,IL,That that's such a surprise
JOE,IL,Yeah
FRED,IL,H
JIM,IL,And what what what we would do is they would take care of the account maintainance
FRED,IL,Hx
JIM,IL,H In a similar manner if you will as H they take care of the the other qualified plans
JOE,IL,Mhm
JIM,IL,H We They We send them the information th
JOE,IL,But they print it and
JIM,IL,They They crank out the numbers
JOE,IL,qualify it and
JIM,IL,H And and they file whatever needs to be filed
JOE,IL,disclose it Mhm
JIM,IL,H The It's really not gonna cost us it it's gonna be pretty much of a swap Right now H we use their eight-hundred number and their uh fi their newsletter for the IRAs We don't have their comprehensive service we have their IRA service H And that runs about three-hundred dollars a year If you go to the comprehensive account maintenance the eight-hundred number is included and the f and the newsletter is included So we would drop three-hundred dollars off H The account maintenance comprehensive account X maintenance X maintenance would cost us five-hundred dollars H But what you do is they he estimates it'd be five-hundred dollars for a minimal number of accounts H Banker System charges thirty-five dollars an account And he said under a self-directed arrangement he's seen charges to maintain a self-directed IRA anywhere from forty H to a hundred fifty dollars Now I think a hundred fifty dollars H is a lot H to maintain a self-directed IRA
FRED,IL,Mhm So you mean
JIM,IL,%
FRED,IL,that you we could pass that back to the customer That's what you're saying
JIM,IL,Right Right H We
FRED,IL,They charge us five-hundred plus thirty-five per account
JIM,IL,Well he he thought he's gonna send me down the information you know how the typical salesman they H they they d talk in kind of nebulous terms
FRED,IL,Yeah
JIM,IL,but he thought
FRED,IL,Okay
JIM,IL,H w they they have a minimum H number of accounts
FRED,IL,Oh with w is covered if you will by the five-hundred.
JIM,IL,H Yes
FRED,IL,Okay
JIM,IL,And so he said H way I understood it would let's say five-hundred would would cover the eight-hundred which is very very helpful service
FRED,IL,Mhm
JIM,IL,H and uh the maintenance for let's say twenty accounts Well if we had ten accounts
FRED,IL,Okay
JIM,IL,we would charge H five-hundred fifty dollars on ac on an account it would be five-hundred dollars it's really kind of a switch around but H what what that would I think it would be good for H the five or six of us H to to have Galino down here H can kind of explain what products we can offer from the bank side
JOE,IL,Hm
JIM,IL,Matt needs to know that and and we all need to know that H and then we can figure out how Matt's the products that LCL's gonna offer will plug into that And it's I was thinking of sending Matt up there for a week H but H you know he's up there a week he's gonna learn a lot of very technical information such as like those section four-fifteen H XSes That that I was talking about H You really don't need to know the H the technical H nitty-gritty about it because that's what Bankers Systems does They take care of the nitty-gritty
JOE,IL,Hm
JIM,IL,So H it's gonna be less expensive to have Galino come here instead of one person going up to to Minnesota for a week and then trying to bring back the information we're gonna have Galino come down here for a day and he won't he won't touch any H specific complicated items Such as four-fifteen XSes or H or ACP testing or that Cause Vivian and I kind of know that H but if we don't know that
JOE,IL,THROAT
JIM,IL,like that four-fifteen uh XS
FRED,IL,Mhm
JIM,IL,H I called the eight-hundred number and and they went through the explanation where the IRS H changed the the deduction
FRED,IL,Just a Just a question from a mechanics H Who's gonna hold the account Is LCL gonna hold the account is the bank gonna ho hold the account Who act You know you're talking about bank products and and LCL products like before the trust department H if you will held H the account That that's physically where it was
JIM,IL,Mhm
FRED,IL,you know Is H is it's I is the plan gonna be in the bank or will the plan be in LCL or is the plan H just kind of nebulous
JIM,IL,Well well the the SEP and the IRA H will will be First National Bank of Hillsdale
FRED,IL,Okay That's what I meant
JIM,IL,But but tho those
FRED,IL,They're bank products if you will We offer those H and then LCL if will have within that plan they'll have things you can buy if you want to direct it that way If you don't want a CD
JIM,IL,Tha the
FRED,IL,or if you want something else H you could direct that H that the monies be used to buy some mutual fund or some bond fund or something
JIM,IL,Right And how I envision that then
FRED,IL,Okay
JIM,IL,H we would get the statement from LCL for the mutual fund holdings H let's say the person also had a CD
FRED,IL,Okay Mhm
JIM,IL,Let's You know it doesn't matter how X they X split it
FRED,IL,Like we do now
JIM,IL,H And then then H what what we would have to do is pull that information together H We would get LCL's statement as of the end of the year What the income was H and what the balance was we would then have to if they had a CD H pull that in we would report that H up to Bankers Systems
FRE,IL, Okay
FRE,IL," H and they would then combine that, and produce the report H It That's why there's normally a cost in those self-directed H because it's not H with our CDs now H that information that's the whole account and whatever's out there on the on the retire on the RAP record H just passes right up and and the CD and the RAP information r retirement account processing system talk together"
FRED,IL,Mhm
JIM,IL,H When you get another vendor in here like LCL H we physically have to put the papers together But it's not that complicated
JOE,IL,But the name of his office is gonna be LCL
JIM,IL,S
JOE,IL,It's not gonna be First National Bank H
JIM,IL,Right Right
JOE,IL,Anything
JIM,IL,H The the I got a f Oh Hx Yeah I love expansions of business It took me forty-five minutes to get a phone number
FRED,IL,Hx
JIM,IL,The phone number by the way is
JOE,IL,For LCL Yeah
JIM,IL,POUND five five five five five five five POUND Is what the phone number will be H But this is things that H I'm I'm anxious for Matt to get here because I'm getting H I'm getting tuckered out trying to get all these nitty-gritty things
FRED,IL,
JIM,IL,It's not tough to get the phone number H But see they need the phone number in order to order letterhead
JOE,IL,Mhm
JIM,IL,H in order to or have business cards H LCL in .. in Chicago needs that
FRED,IL,Mhm
JIM,IL,to get that process going
JOE,IL,Hm
JIM,IL,Uh
JOE,IL,TSK H Uh is there LCL accounts gonna be maintained here
JIM,IL,cause cause actually
JOE,IL,I mean or is there gonna be a separate H They're gonna have an account in Chicago for the funds to pass through Or is it gonna be passthrough funds here at the bank Or H is that
JIM,IL,Well w what we'll do is those'll probably wire transfer out
JOE,IL,Through Boltmans or something
JIM,IL,"Well through the Fed what H I think what will happen, H but we Matt'll find this out and I mean we'll get involved in it H and I'm I'm not whichever way it goes is fine but probably the most sophisticated way H will be H everyone who makes who buys a fund or whatever that money will go into a a clearing account here And then H we will either LCL will will ACH it out of us"
JOE,IL,XX XX
JIM,IL,Or we'll physically wire it up there X You know X there may be H a hundred thousand dollars in there which may represent three people's or four people's purchases
JOE,IL,Mhm
JIM,IL,H and then Matt faxes the paperwork up to LCL and they do the suitability testing and then they know what products have been bought and then on the other side we do a wire transfer to physically get the money up there I think that's how it's gonna work
FRED,IL,Si similar to Fannie Mae
JIM,IL,Ex ex Uh yes
JOE,IL,Mhm
JIM,IL,Sa same same- same type of thing
JOE,IL,Yeah
FRED,IL,We we we collect monies
JOE,IL,Custodial account
FRED,IL,we collect monies
JOE,IL,X and X>
FRED,IL,put it in account and then we tell them how much of it is theirs and by calling up there
JOE,IL,XXX
FRED,IL,and that dial deal and then it they zap it the next day
JIM,IL,Yeah I don't know if
JOE,IL,Okay
JIM,IL,H like that's the same way that uh American Express with the traveler's checks work H When we sell Traveler's Checks we put that money in a clearing account H and then Jo Anne or Grace or Tom or somebody calls H whosever doing that job calls H a number
FRED,IL,Mhm
JIM,IL,and we report how much in H sales we had H and they d they d hit the account the next day and take the money out But that's H that's kind of the the mechanics of the of the flow of funds H But to answer your question Joe is that H LCL that office will not say First National Bank of Hillsdale or anything of the nature
JOE,IL,Anywhere Yeah
JIM,IL,H Uh the his H his card will be LCL investments H at First National Bank of Hillsdale H Um letterhead will be LCL there needs to be a separate phone line POUND going to that office POUND H And we'll we'll be able when we get this receptionist set up H the receptionist will also answer it but when they pick up the phone H you know we'll put it on a red line or blue line or something like that H when they pick up that line like we do with with with Bill's number H you know they they pick up and they'll say LCL investments H They also   . . H and it's also requirements by uh uh I guess NASDAQ or whomever H and the comptroller that they don't want us H when that line rings we're not gonna pick it up and go hello First National Bank of Hillsdale and they go H Q oh yeah I wanted to talk about a mutual fund oh I'm sorry yeah you do have LCL H in investments Q I mean these are some of the nitty-gritty things
JOE,IL,TSK Yeah They H they talk about in the regulation and I'm pretty confident they'll they'll implement those out But

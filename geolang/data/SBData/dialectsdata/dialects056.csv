JULIE,NA,H He's only three H And we tried breeding him to a mare the other day and she was going out of heat wasn't very strong And he was just a lot more interested in the Gelding next to her and I said this is what I need is a gay stallion
GARY,VA/CA,@@@@ SNIFF
JULIE,NA,H @@@@@@@
MATT,VA/NM,@@@@
GARY,VA/CA,A gay stallion
JULIE,NA,Oh I said VOX well that way at least I don't have to worry VOX about gelding him And he'll keep his pretty coat you know we just won't worry about him And he's real even tempered but We just had his first foal He did manage to breed my old mare last year But she's really experienced H And I just turned em out to pasture together for three days H and she was patient with him
MATT,VA/NM,Hm
JULI,VA/NM, H But then he fell in love with her and it was HORSE WHINNY
JULIE,NA,He was Um what do you call it He only wanted the one mare He wouldn't look at any of the others last year So we didn't get anybody else bred last year But two is a little young to be asking anything Watch this now Watch him rush WH at her H rush at her WH X See if he goes X See and her buddy um the reason she's here this black mare she's here for board and training she hadn't been ridden in five years And her um pal of ten ye ten years had to be put down a few weeks ago He just was so crippled up and old and
GARY,VA/CA,Mm
JULIE,NA,suffering and H she didn't want to keep the mare at home after they put the other horse down cause she figured she'd get frantic So she came here to have more friends To make friends
GARY,VA/CA,Yeah
JULIE,NA,Well these are
GARY,VA/CA,So what did you do to your arena
JULIE,NA,H Um well last year I put in a whole new ring I spent about three thousand dollars leveling it Because it wasn't quite level I I'd had it leveled when I moved here but it w really wasn't level
GARY,VA/CA,Mhm
JULIE,NA,H And the sand that I had in it There was natural sand in it when I bought the place H It had all washed down the road and I p think Kettle Creek scooped it up and put it in their ring H So it was hard as a rock
GARY,VA/CA,WH WH
JULIE,NA,And it kept washing out And it was terrible and like riding on asphalt So Hx I had
GARY,VA/CA,Well you were probably down to the hardpack
JULIE,NA,I was down to clay
GARY,VA/CA,Mm
JULIE,NA,H And I had Havens come out and with a bulldozer And he leveled the whole thing he took a whole bunch out of this corner you can see
GARY,VA/CA,Yeah
JULIE,NA,H And put it down in that corner
GARY,VA/CA,Yeah
JULIE,NA,H And it just was a lot nicer And then I had three-hundred tons of sand brought in and spread
GARY,VA/CA,WHISTLE
JULIE,NA,H It was great in the winter time When it was all frozen and I had this much soft stuff on top H but when it thawed H we couldn't ride in it it was this deep
GARY,VA/CA,Oh
JULIE,NA,It was horrid And the horses have had a hard time
GARY,VA/CA,Too much
JULIE,NA,H So today Finally it's been dry enough for Tad to come out and and take the rest of the sand off And I sold it to him
GARY,VA/CA,Oh he was taking it out
JULIE,NA,H He was taking it out
GARY,VA/CA,Oh okay I saw the big dumptruck
JULIE,NA,H Yeah Well that was Havens was taking it out Um Orville Havens and uh his son Which I can't remember his name Starts with an el Lenny or something
GARY,VA/CA,And he was taking it to someplace else
JULIE,NA,Lenny and Orville H He was taking it to one of my students who lives on the road behind me who put in a ring but didn't have any sand yet
GARY,VA/CA,Okay Okay
JULIE,NA,H So she got a great deal She got about a third of my sand H that I paid Hx twelve or thirteen-hundred dollars for delivered H and she got it a got about a third of it for about two-hundred and fifty bucks
GARY,VA/CA,Hey that's good
JULIE,NA,And so it was a lot cheaper than if she'd bought it
GARY,VA/CA,Yeah
JULIE,NA,cause I only charged her H a buck Hx a buck a ton which is what I paid for it But then I had to pay a lot more to have it hauled in
GARY,VA/CA,Yeah
JULIE,NA,H The hauling is what costs so much <X But I'll sh X>
GARY,VA/CA,So uh yeah you know My my arena isn't very level
JULIE,NA,H Well it cost her a lot less to level hers but it wasn't as big as mine or as unlevel This is my tractor It's masquerading as an Isuzu But it really is my tractor
GARY,VA/CA,Foggy meadows
JULIE,NA,My handyman did that I haven't seen him for a while I think he quit And didn't tell me That's my roommate One of my roommate's horses is here CRK and one's in there but CRK he's hiding And then this is the field This is what we call the witch field the mares live out there they get turned out there during the day and then that's the gelding field and my stallion lives out with the geldings And Bruge stands here half the day wanting to come in and then after he goes in he wants to go out
GARY,VA/CA,
JULIE,NA,He's like a lotta people's children in the winter time
GARY,VA/CA,The mare field and the gelding field
JULIE,NA,And the Chestnut You see a dark grey on this side And then a chestnut with his tail to us
GARY,VA/CA,Yeah
JULIE,NA,The chestnut is my stallion Hx And he's just as mellow as H He's mellower than most geldings He's a sweetheart And the mare and baby are up the road a half mile If you go through the gateposts Th where it says Stray Winds Two H And just go through there and look to your left there's a pasture And I've got the mare and baby up there in a seven-acre pasture
GARY,VA/CA,Wow
JULIE,NA,And we've got
GARY,VA/CA,<P Wow P>
JULIE,NA,Right now we're down to twenty horses here Which is great Hx And then H my roommate's old horse is going out to pasture the first of the month too He's um had a real rough year he had cancer and he lost one eye and the other eye is going blind and this'll probably be his last summer and Hx
GARY,VA/CA,Mm
JULIE,NA,she's not riding him a whole lot But he's still pretty happy H So we'll put him out to pasture and let him eat grass for a summer and Hx see how he is in the fall And if he's Hx if he's Hx H looks like he's gonna lose the sight in the other eye totally we'll put him down in the fall Hx I'm not gonna let him wander around blind Hx It's not fair to him He's been a grand horse But none of ours go to the killers at the end of their life Hx
GARY,VA/CA,Where do they go
JULIE,NA,They get put down and then either buried or just hauled off Hx H But we put em down at home TSK I don't I don't put them through going out to the sale and H being menh manhandled and stuck in semi trucks and scared to death at the l end of their lives I just Hx
GARY,VA/CA,Hm
JULIE,NA,H don't believe in that That's probably why I'll always be poor Hx H But I do a lotta horse rescue I've bought a lot from the killers Um in fact this black horse of my roommate's came from he was going to the killer's four years ago Not this one The one that is b blind now And he was considered a killer An unmanageable And he's been perfectly lovely I give the little kids lessons on him
GARY,VA/CA,Hm
JULIE,NA,So I've had him four years Sold him to my roommate a couple years ago it was her second horse And uh they've cleaned up in competitive trail and just had a great time and fox hunted him and H He's just real game
GARY,VA/CA,Hm
JULIE,NA,He's a purebred Arabian All black And he's just great And uh an nother one I saved from the killers three years ago the light chestnut with the blond tail swishing at us
GARY,VA/CA,Yeah
JULIE,NA,He's a mustang And he was four years old going to the killers out at Calhan H and he was way down on the sales list and he was pretty spooky So I m I had eight horses at the time so I made one of my customers buy him I said he's VOX gonna make a wonderful hunt horse when he gets broke VOX Hx
GARY,VA/CA,Hx
JULIE,NA,H And he did And he's absolutely lovely and he now belongs to a sixteen-year-old girl who competes him in H hunter jumper

JULIE,NA,
GARY,VA/CA,mean making X you X pull a wagon
JULIE,NA,H Yes making him pull a cart
GARY,VA/CA,Oh okay Okay
JULIE,NA,H Well we did all the groundwork
GARY,VA/CA,H X There's X>
JULIE,NA,This horse was doing great on the ground we'd harnessed him We'd been doing for two years You know let's break this horse to drive Cause he's part Belgian He's pretty cute He's about a quarter Belgian H And he came from around Reno Nevada And uh so we did all the groundwork just had a great time with him H and I had this guy come out that drives Belgians and and he was gonna put in fence posts but the ground was too frozen So H he said VOX well I don't have anything else to do VOX and I told him about this horse he said let me see this horse And he had Belgians he said wow he does look like a baby Belgian He's real cute H And he asked me what I'd done to him and
GARY,VA/CA,Hx Baby Bel-
JULIE,NA,and I said well we've done all this groundwork we've drug a drag with him and he's doing really good H So he put the harness on checked it all out for me cause I don't know as that much about it which is why I'd never hooked him to a cart We just played on the ground H And um he said well everything's good here and he drove him around put the drag on him he said oh this horse is ready to drive I said are you sure H I said when this horse spooks it's a pretty tremendous spook
GARY,VA/CA,Hm
JULIE,NA,H VOX I said and you don't want him to spook VOX H He said VOX nah he's gonna be just fine VOX H He hooked him to the cart He got in told me let go I stepped back two steps the horse took two steps bucked H kicked the guy out of the cart H took off the barn door was open This used to be set up a little differently H Um
GARY,VA/CA,Hx
JULIE,NA,this fence went straight across and this was one big field H And I had a different gate Because he destroyed it H He came out the end of the barn H jumped a four-and-a-half-foot gate
GARY,VA/CA,Hx@Hx
JULIE,NA,The cart of course smashed the gate And he went tearing around this whole field with all the other horses in here H for probably ten minutes And he jumped
GARY,VA/CA,With paraphernalia probably straps hanging to him right
JULIE,NA,No The cart was still attached
GARY,VA/CA,Hx
JULIE,NA,MRC The cart was still attached MRC
GARY,VA/CA,H The cart went through the gate H Gee
JULIE,NA,H The c the cart went through the gate knocked the gate flat
GARY,VA/CA,H
JULIE,NA,I It was one of the aluminum type type gates
GARY,VA/CA,
JULIE,NA,like that little one
GARY,VA/CA,H
JULIE,NA,Only it was the big one
GARY,VA/CA,Yeah
JULIE,NA,H And it was flat it was mushed that's why I had to get a new gate H And uh
GARY,VA/CA,Incredible
JULIE,NA,well I've replaced fences since then H But he went tearing around scared all the other horses to death and there was a section down there which used to be a part of a fence You can see it See the part tha It just makes kind of a upside-down U
GARY,VA/CA,Yeah Yeah
JULIE,NA,H He jumped that with the cart too and knocked it over I mean he cleared it H But the cart knocked it over H And sent that all flying And finally the cart's wheels got smashed enough that it just wasn't dragging too well anymore and he was dragging dead weight And he fi he stopped up on top of this hill H and I was going holy cow
GARY,VA/CA,Golly day
JULIE,NA,And in the meantime I had a little mini about this big that was out there and he got trampled by the other horses He was okay
GARY,VA/CA,Mm

GARY,VA/CA,Mm
JULIE,NA,And uh but
GARY,VA/CA,So much for uh carts
JULIE,NA,H I walked up there Hx and H hoping he wouldn't run over me with what was left of the cart H And I took a knife with me and I was a And I didn't have to use it I was able to just unhook everything pretty quick and let him out of the shafts H And um he h The only injury he had And part of the time the shafts and it's a metal cart the shaft was under his belly and in between his front legs and I thought he's gonna tear himself apart
GARY,VA/CA,Mm

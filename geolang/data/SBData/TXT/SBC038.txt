0.000	0.708	BEN:	.. Okay folks,
0.708	2.142		we're coming to a short stairway,
2.142	2.970		use the handrails,
2.970	4.087		and be careful please.
4.087	94.800	>ENV:	((FOOTSTEPS_AND_AMBIENT_CROWD_NOISE))
94.800	95.277	BEN:	Okay folks,
95.277	96.340		let's find out where we are.
96.340	98.341		... We got on the elevator right here,
98.341	101.019		.. came down and stood on the balcony overlooking the power plant,
101.019	102.583		... (H) down that stairway,
102.583	104.621		out on the power plant ramp about that far,
104.621	106.508		(H) then right at that yellow line.
106.508	110.367		(H) And you're now standing over the second-largest water pipe in the world,
110.367	112.169		(H) and it's called a penstock.
112.169	113.829		... More about that a little bit later.
113.829	115.576		.. (H) The Colorado River,
115.576	116.871		flows in this direction.
116.871	118.334		(H) In order to build a dam here,
118.334	119.995		the very first thing they had to do=,
119.995	121.498		(H) was to get rid of that river.
121.498	124.062		.. (H) So they came up here above where the dam was to be built,
124.062	125.615		(H) and drilled and blasted out,
125.615	127.057		four diversion tunnels.
127.057	128.712		(H) Two on either si=de,
128.712	130.008		(H) into the canyon wall,
130.008	131.566		around where the dam was to be built,
131.566	133.106		(H) out in the river down below.
133.106	137.059		(H) Each one of these tunnels were drilled and blasted out at fifty-six feet in diameter,
137.059	139.037		(H) and then lined with three feet of concrete.
139.037	141.740		.. (H) You're now standing in one of those old diversion tunnels.
141.740	143.063		... (H) They then came up here,
143.063	145.367		and they built a cofferdam about a hundred feet high,
145.367	148.081		(H) to force this river into these diversion tunnels.
148.081	149.225		(H) Came back down here,
149.225	150.932		built the other part of that cofferda=m,
150.932	152.823		(H) about sixty-five feet high=,
152.823	155.578		(H) to keep this water from backing into the work area.
155.578	157.284		(H) They now had from he=re,
157.284	159.045		(H) to here where they could build a dam.
159.045	161.085		.. (H) They pumped the water out of this area,
161.085	164.614		(H) and excavated down another hundred and thirty-five feet to bedrock.
164.614	165.550		.. (H) Okay folks,
165.550	166.210		if you will please,
166.210	168.142		take a look at this picture taken during construction,
168.142	170.764		.. (H) looks like a series of boxes or blocks,
170.764	172.160		stacked one on top of the other,
172.160	174.694		.. (H) and those are wooden concrete fo=rms.
174.694	177.381		(H) Each one of those forms are exactly five feet high,
177.381	179.659		(H) but they did vary in area somewhat,
179.659	182.756		(H) because they did not build the dam right straight across the river,
182.756	184.641		(H) from canyon wall to canyon wa=ll,
184.641	186.624		(H) they built it in the form of an arc.
186.624	189.457		... And it's called an arch .. gravity design dam.
189.457	190.965		(H) Where the force of the water,
190.965	193.414		coming down the Colorado River hits the face of the dam,
193.414	197.085		(H) and tends to try to drive these wingtips further into the canyon wa=ll.
197.085	199.179		.. (H) It's a very strong design.
199.179	202.265		... They did build two concrete mixing plants here,
202.265	204.764		(H) they did pour concrete for twenty-four hours a day,
204.764	205.808		seven days a week,
205.808	208.020		(H) three hundred and sixty-five days a year.
208.020	209.282		(H) For two years,
209.282	211.010		.. less ... six days.
211.010	215.743		(H) Now every bit of that concrete came down in individual eight-cubic-yard bucketloads.
215.743	218.384		(H) Eight cubic yards of concrete into one of these forms,
218.384	221.163		(H) the smallest of which is twenty-two by twenty-five feet,
221.163	224.279		(H) only filled that form up about three or four inches deep.
224.279	226.543		.. (H) So there goes that story you may have hea=rd,
226.543	228.852		(H) that there are workers buried in the concrete here.
228.852	230.385		.. Couldn't possibly happen.
230.385	233.313		.. (H) But what they did bury in that freshly poured concrete,
233.313	235.110		(H) was one-inch steel water pipe.
235.110	237.513		.. (H) They came down here in this lower cofferda=m,
237.513	239.354		(H)= and they built an i=ce plant.
239.354	242.284		.. Capable of making a thousand tons of ice a day.
242.284	243.653		(H) They used that ice,
243.653	244.716		to chill the water,
244.716	247.705		(H) that they forced through that pipe in this newly placed concrete.
247.705	249.241		.. (H) As concrete ha=rdens,
249.241	250.501		or cures as we call it,
250.501	251.867		(H) it produces heat.
251.867	254.000		... The more you can control that heat,
254.000	256.033		(H) the better job of curing you're going to get.
256.033	257.910		.. (H) So they used the chilled water method,
257.910	259.011		of taking that cold water,
259.011	261.695		(H) forcing it through that pipe in that newly placed concrete,
261.695	263.338		(H) picking up some of that heat,
263.338	265.191		(H) then carrying that heat out and away.
265.191	268.036		.. (H) They felt if they did not use a method such as this,
268.036	271.600		.. that it would've taken approximately (H) one hundred and fifty years,
271.600	274.952		for the concrete .. in the interior part of the dam (H) to cool down.
274.952	276.454		.. (H) So the system did work.
276.454	277.555		... And then it hardened,
277.555	279.138		and they remove these wooden forms,
279.138	280.185		.. <X they X> left voids.
280.185	282.380		Vertically and horizontally these forms came together,
282.380	284.248		(H) those voids were filled with grout.
284.248	285.215		Under high pressure.
285.215	287.452		... Grout being a mixture of concrete and water.
287.452	288.601		... (H) When this is done,
288.601	291.376		you have what we call a modified monolithic pour,
291.376	293.568		(H) or basically a solid block of concrete,
293.568	297.237		(H) which when completed would be six hundred and sixty feet across the base,
297.237	299.245		(H) fourty-five feet across the top,
299.245	302.187		(H) twelve hundred and fourty-four feet from wingtip to wingtip,
302.187	305.229		(H) seven hundred and twenty-six point four feet high.
305.229	309.063		... <MRC Six point six million tons of concrete MRC>.
309.063	313.871		... That's enough concrete to build a two-lane highway (H) from New York City to San Francisco.
313.871	314.562		... O=r,
314.562	315.313		put another way,
315.313	318.459		(H) a four-foot wide sidewalk from the North Pole to the South Pole.
318.459	320.785		.. (H) Then they had to protect that concrete a little bit,
320.785	323.728		(H) the next thing they had to do then is build a couple of spillways.
323.728	326.260		(H) As you got out of your cars or your busses this afternoon,
326.260	327.816		you may have noticed those spillways.
327.816	328.543		(H) Here they are,
328.543	329.686		one on either side.
329.686	330.808		.. (H) What they did,
330.808	331.507		is they came in here,
331.507	334.400		and they blocked these diversion tunnels off in this area through here,
334.400	336.328		... (H) closed these gates up here,
336.328	339.126		(H) now this yellow part is forever under water.
339.126	340.500		(H) Underneath that lake out there,
340.500	341.699		and completely useless.
341.699	343.281		(H) But they did incorporate,
343.281	344.791		into the design of the dam,
344.791	346.950		(H) the balance of those diversion tunnels,
346.950	349.996		.. (H) using these outer two as spillway tunnels.
349.996	351.582		(H) Now these spillways were built,
351.582	353.106		so that the top of the spi=llway,
353.106	356.066		(H) is twenty-seven feet lower than the top of the dam.
356.066	360.121		.. (H) This assures us that n- any excess water coming down the Colorado River,
360.121	362.260		(H) rather than overtopping the dam,
362.260	364.772		(H) overtops these spillways on either side,
364.772	366.261		(H) goes into the canyon wall,
366.261	367.225		around the dam,
367.225	368.850		(H) out in the river down below.
368.850	374.900		.. (H) Each one of these spillways is capable of handling (H) two hundred th=ousand cubic feet per second of water.
374.900	377.856		.. (H) That's the same amount of water that goes over Niagara Falls.
377.856	380.358		.. (H) <X Falls X> three times higher than Niagara Falls does,
380.358	382.653		(H) time that water reaches this area down in here,
382.653	384.709		(H) it is flowing at between one hundred,
384.709	386.764		(H) and one hundred and twenty miles an hour.
386.764	389.016		... (H) Okay we have protected the spillways,
389.016	390.548		(H) now they had to get some water,
390.548	392.095		.. (H) %- into the power plant.
392.095	394.626		... What they did is they built four intake towers.
394.626	396.714		(H) Two on either side of the (H) river,
396.714	398.037		on ledges above the river,
398.037	400.754		(H) each of those towers that you saw out there in that lake,
400.754	403.271		... are three hundred and ninety-five feet high.
403.271	406.446		... Each with two-eleven-by-thirty-two-foot gates in them,
406.446	407.703		(H) one gate near the bottom,
407.703	408.784		one about half way up,
408.784	410.212		(H) to let the water in.
410.212	412.273		(H) The water then coming into the penstocks,
412.273	414.182		(H) like the one we're standing over right now.
414.182	415.438		... (H) This penstock,
415.438	417.204		you can see on either side of us out here,
417.204	418.468		(H) is three stories high,
418.468	419.879		or thirty feet in diameter,
419.879	422.963		made of two-and-three-quarter-inch steel boilerplate.
422.963	425.360		.. (H) Made in section twenty-two feet long.
425.360	429.277		.. Each section weighing approximately (H) a hundred and fifty tons.
429.277	432.248		(H) Each of these twenty-two-foot sections is joined to the next section,
432.248	434.021		(H) using pressure pins like thi=s.
434.021	436.874		.. (H) The water pressure in that penstock out there this afternoon,
436.874	440.220		(H) approximately two hundred and thirty-four pounds per square inch.
440.220	442.000		... (H) Okay we have the water this far,
442.000	445.162		now we divert that into thirteen-foot penstocks or water pipes,
445.162	446.814		(H) each one of em going to a turbine.
446.814	449.295		... (H) The force of the water turns the turbine,
449.295	451.099		which turns the rotor in the generator,
451.099	452.411		(H) and generates power.
452.411	454.564		... The water then coming on the tailrace,
454.564	455.530		we saw it up there,
455.530	458.911		(H) and going on downstream to be used at least .. six more times,
458.911	460.589		before it reaches the Mexican border,
460.589	461.963		(H) to generate more power.
461.963	465.736		.. (H) Good clean .. reusable non-polluting source of energy.
465.736	468.306		... (TSK) (H) The cost of the project.
468.306	470.889		... A hundred and seventy-five million dollars.
470.889	472.143		... I say project,
472.143	474.060		because that includes the building of the dam,
474.060	476.854		(H) the building of Boulder City about seven miles up the road,
476.854	480.302		(H) the highway and the railway from Las Vegas out here to the dam site,
480.302	483.399		(H) and in southern California they built the All-American Canal,
483.399	485.842		(H) which takes water to the people and the crops,
485.842	487.935		.. of the Imperial and Coachella Valleys.
487.935	491.323		(H) This money was borrowed on a fifty-year term at three-percent interest,
491.323	494.174		(H) and was paid off in fu=ll in nineteen eighty-seven.
494.174	496.063		... The people who worked here,
496.063	497.806		and they did work twenty-four hours a day,
497.806	501.208		(H) average twenty-four-hour work force was about thirty-five hundred men.
501.208	504.748		.. (H) The most they had at any one time was when they were pouring concrete,
504.748	506.385		(H) fourty-three hundred men.
506.385	509.793		... (H) The laborers on the job made fifty cents an hour.
509.793	513.058		.. (H) Highest paid man on the project was a power shovel operator,
513.058	515.007		(H) at a dollar and a qu=arter an hour.
515.007	516.603		... (H) Out of each man's paycheck,
516.603	518.832		the contractor did deduct each day,
518.832	520.771		(H) a dollar and sixty cents.
520.771	522.825		(H) Because the contractor was feeding,
522.825	524.877		(H) and housing the men in Boulder City,
524.877	527.524		(H) and taking them back and forth out here to the job site.
527.524	531.020		... They did have ninety-six .. industrial deaths.
531.020	534.561		.. The biggest single category of death was classified as falling material.
534.561	536.187		(H) Basically falling rock.
536.187	538.607		... But they did have some killed by explosion,
538.607	539.777		(H) some by drowning,
539.777	540.995		some by electrocution,
540.995	543.769		(H) and other types of accidents you might expect to have.
543.769	545.348		(H) On a job of this magnitude.
545.348	547.457		... They did complete the project,
547.457	548.651		two years ahead of schedule,
548.651	549.663		and under budget.
549.663	551.606		(H) Started in early nineteen thirty-one,
551.606	553.783		(H) completed in late nineteen thirty-five.
553.783	556.139		(H) Just twelve days short .. of five years.
556.139	558.082		... (H) Do I have any questions.
558.082	560.585	AUD:	... What's this overhead pipe here X.
560.585	561.630	BEN:	(H) The overhead pipe.
561.630	562.837		(H) That's the fresh air pipe.
562.837	564.928		.. (H) ... In the summerti=me,
564.928	567.904		(H) the temperature of the air outside gets to be as high as a hundred and twenty degrees.
567.904	569.449		(H) So they bring that fresh air i=n,
569.449	572.377		(H) and they pass that fresh air over a sump at the base of the dam,
572.377	575.148		(H) the water in that sump is a constant fifty-three degrees.
575.148	578.530		(H) It cools that air down to between sixty-eight and seventy-two degrees,
578.530	580.516		(H) then they force it back throughout the dam.
580.516	582.699		(H) So it's %air-conditioning without refrigeration.
582.699	584.650		Like a big evaporative cooler or swamp cooler.
584.650	586.590		... Any other questions.
586.590	587.344		... Yes.
587.344	588.612	AUD:	... U=h,
588.612	591.056		during the uh ... earthquake this morning,
591.056	592.275		do you have any sensors down here,
592.275	594.004		that .. measure any kind of movement,
594.004	595.885		o=f ... str[uctur]=es,
595.186	595.574	BEN:	[<X Right X>].
595.885	596.524		... Yes.
596.524	597.836		.. W- v- we have several things.
597.836	600.112		.. First place we have three seismographs throughout the dam.
600.112	601.070		(H) We recorded those,
601.070	602.219		but nobody down here felt em.
602.219	603.664		(H) But we do have sensors,
603.664	604.786		built right into the concrete,
604.786	606.431		(H) any movement that concrete makes,
606.431	607.860		.. is measured and recorded.
607.860	609.850		... And they had very little of it this morning.
609.850	610.593		Very little.
610.593	612.879		... Any other questions.
612.879	614.699	AUD:	... How far are you sending electricity.
614.699	615.337		California?
615.337	615.836	BEN:	.. Okay.
615.836	618.470		.. Fifty-six percent of our power goes to southern California,
618.470	620.321		(H) twenty-five percent of it stays in Nevada,
620.321	622.490		(H) nineteen percent of it goes to Arizona.
622.490	623.682		(H) What the government did,
623.682	626.909		is they got together the delegates from those three states in nineteen thirty.
626.909	630.226		(H) To allocate the power that would be generated here when this dam was completed.
630.226	632.697		.. (H) California was growing very fast at that time,
632.697	634.359		so they asked for and got most of the power.
634.359	635.872		.. (H) But by the same token,
635.872	636.405		Las Vegas,
636.405	638.021		about thirty-five miles up the road here,
638.021	639.192		(H) at that time,
639.192	641.474		(H) was nothing but a watering stop on the railroad.
641.474	642.504		(H) No hotels,
642.504	643.396		no casinos,

1263.768	1266.845		... (H) .. Any other questions folks.
1266.845	1267.820		... Yes.
1267.820	1270.809	AUD:	... What are the chances .. of a leak?
1270.809	1271.522	BEN:	... Hm?
1271.522	1272.150	AUD_2:	@[@@]
1271.792	1273.679	AUD:	[What are the] chances of a leak.
1273.679	1274.222	BEN:	(H) <X Well X>,
1274.222	1275.433		.. % it leaks all the time.
1275.433	1277.075		(H) You see concrete's porous.
1277.075	1278.362		(H) And because concrete's porous,
1278.362	1279.888		there's water coming through at all times.
1279.888	1281.007		(H) But that's good.
1281.007	1283.091		(H) Because if <X there're X> no moisture in concrete,
1283.091	1284.067		(H) it dries out,
1284.067	1285.190		an=d .. spalls and chips,
1285.190	1286.337		an=d .. turns to powder.
1286.337	1287.834		(H) Wouldn't make a very good dam.
1287.834	1289.450		(H) So as long as that lake is back there,
1289.450	1291.713		forcing that water through the concrete at all times,
1291.713	1294.461		(H) it keeps that concrete in a stage of what we call being green.
1294.461	1296.504		(H) Green concrete's very strong.
1296.504	1298.006		(H) So we have a good strong dam.
1298.006	1299.347	AUD:	... Say ~Ben,
1299.347	1299.828	BEN:	.. [Yes].
1299.565	1301.000	AUD:	[what's going] on up on the hill up here,

1301.222	1301.415	BEN:	[2Okay.
1301.415	1303.210		.. That's a2] five-story parking garage,
1303.210	1305.125		(H) and the new building is a new visitors center.
1305.125	1308.047		.. (H) The five-story parking garage will hold four-hundred and fifty cars.
1308.047	1308.797		(H) Okay,
1308.797	1310.101		the new f- (H) visitors center,
1310.101	1312.483		(H) will have ... three revolving theaters in it,
1312.483	1315.229		... it'll have a .. seating area for people going on tour,
1315.229	1316.122		it'll have a museum,
1316.122	1319.005		(H) the top deck of that building will be an observation platform,
1319.005	1320.872		(H) we can look back at the dam in one direction,
1320.872	1321.761		downstream in the other.
1321.761	1322.510		(H) Now,
1322.510	1323.352		when that's all done,
1323.352	1324.874		(H) they hope to be able to f=igure,
1324.874	1328.386		... to handle .. between one point two and one point three million people a year.
1328.386	1329.672		(H) Last year we had,
1329.672	1333.226		.. seven hundred and twenty-nine thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine people go through the dam,
1333.226	1334.527		(H) but we had to turn people away,
1334.527	1335.455		almost every night.
1335.455	1336.925		... Just not enough time in the day,
1336.925	1338.492		to get everybody through the dam that would like to see it.
1338.492	1338.951	AUD:	.. Hmm.
1338.951	1340.707		... Will it have any slot machines in it?
1340.707	1341.401	BEN:	(H) No,

1381.730	1383.102		this does conclude your tour of the dam,

1384.684	1385.794		(H) come back and see us again,
1385.794	1387.035		have any questions on the way up,

1387.886	1388.878		.. Bye-bye folks.
1388.878	1389.245	AUD:	Thanks ~Ben.
1389.245	1392.091	AUD_2:	... Have they ever had to use the spillway?
1392.091	1392.396	BEN:	Okay.
1392.396	1392.841		.. Folks,
1392.841	1393.545		the question is,
1393.545	1394.985		did they ever have to use the spillway.
1394.985	1395.884		.. (H) Yes.
1395.884	1397.098		Just once in the history of the dam,
1397.098	1398.382		and that was nineteen eighty-three.
1398.382	1400.016		... (H) What happened that year,
1400.016	1402.671		(H) is they had a very heavy snowpack in the Rocky Mountains,
1402.671	1404.981		(H) .. and that was followed by rain and hot weather,
1404.981	1407.106		(H) which created a flooding condition.
1407.106	1410.135		(H) We had more water coming down the Colorado River system,
1410.135	1411.839		(H) than they could put through the power plant.
1411.839	1415.654		.. (H) Every reservoir in the Colorado River system was full to overflowing that year.
1415.654	1416.957		.. (H) On July second,
1416.957	1419.065		... water overtopped our spillways out here.
1419.065	1420.143		(H) Six days later,
1420.143	1422.053		it was going over four and a half feet high.
1422.053	1424.389		(H) And that went on for sixty-six days.
1424.389	1427.150		(H) At the end of that time there was no damage to the dam,
1427.150	1428.385		(H) or to the power plant,
1428.385	1431.491		(H) but further on downstream where people had built in the floodplain,
1431.491	1433.955		(H) they did have thirty million dollars worth of damage,
1433.955	1435.261		(H) but no loss of life.
1435.261	1438.172		... But that flood's what left that white line around the lake out there.
1438.172	1441.268		... That white line indicates it was going over the spillways,
1441.268	1443.383		(H) four and a half feet above floodstage.
1443.383	1444.828		(H) It gives a false impression,
1444.828	1446.745		and makes it look like the lake of the level is low.
1446.745	1448.040		Or level the lake .. of the low.
1448.040	1450.172		.. (H) Actually we're eight feet above normal,
1450.172	1450.999		for this time of year.
1450.999	1452.157	AUD:	... Wow.
1452.157	1454.282	BEN:	.. (H) Yeah we had a very good snowpack last year.
1454.282	1455.974		...

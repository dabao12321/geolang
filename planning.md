# Outline of Project

## Current Steps

1. Research language profiles of U.S. to split into sectors (smaller the better).
2. Derive geographic area of a single word.
3. Derive geographic area of a specific pronounciation of a word.
4. Derive geographic area of a slang word.
5. Create database of classed "buzzwords" (draw from data.gov, NLTK, etc.).
6. Predict origin of speaker through a number of questions. 
7. Predict location of speaker through transcribed speech or writing.

## Future Steps?
7. Plot the popularity of specific words on map.
8. Use machine learning to potentially improve feedback.
9. Expand to other English-speaking countries.
10. Expand to other languages.
